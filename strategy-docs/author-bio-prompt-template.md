```

### **Guidelines for Bio Generation**

1. **Length**: Keep to 1-2 sentences maximum
2. **Emoji Usage**: Include 2-3 relevant emojis (not excessive)
3. **Writing Style Reference**: Connect to their distinctive literary style or famous works
4. **Tool Theme Integration**: Seamlessly blend their literary voice with tool reviewing
5. **Birth Year**: Include their birth year for context
6. **Memorable Quote**: End with a quote that captures their voice applied to tools
7. **Personality**: Maintain each author's distinctive personality and quirks

### **Example Bios**

**Franz Kafka**: "📚 Existential writer turned tool reviewer ⚡️ Transforming hardware anxiety into literary gold since 1883 🔨 'The power drill chooses you'"

**Charles Dickens**: "📖 Victorian novelist crafting epic tool tales 🔧 From workhouse to workshop since 1812 ⚙️ 'It was the best of drills, it was the worst of drills'"

**Ernest Hemingway**: "🥃 Minimalist wordsmith meets maximum power tools 💪 Clean prose, dirty work boots since 1899 🎣 'The drill also rises'"

**Jane Austen**: "✍️ Regency romance meets modern hardware 💍 Crafting tales of love and cordless tools since 1775 🏰 'It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a tradesman in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a drill'"

**Oscar Wilde**: "🎭 Aesthetic wit turned tool connoisseur ✨ Making hardware fabulous since 1854 🌟 'I can resist everything except a good power tool'"

**Virginia Woolf**: "🌊 Stream-of-consciousness meets stream-of-sparks 📝 Capturing the inner life of tools since 1882 💭 'Who's afraid of the big bad drill?'"

### **Tone Considerations**

- **Playful but respectful** of the author's literary legacy
- **Clever wordplay** that connects literary works to tool themes
- **Authentic voice** that feels like something the author might actually say
- **Memorable and quotable** for social media sharing
- **Brand-appropriate** for Bunnings parody context

### **Implementation Notes**

This template should be used to generate bios that will be stored directly in the author JSON files as a `bio` field. The bios should feel authentic to each author's voice while maintaining the playful parody tone of the overall site.

### **Author Context for Bio Generation**

When generating bios, consider:
- **Famous Works**: Their most well-known literary pieces
- **Writing Style**: Minimalist, verbose, experimental, etc.
- **Historical Context**: Time period and cultural background
- **Personality Traits**: Wit, melancholy, optimism, etc.
- **Literary Movement**: Romanticism, Modernism, Victorian, etc.

The bio should capture the essence of who they were as writers while imagining them as enthusiastic tool reviewers in the modern Bunnings context.
