# Agent B Strategy: Floating Wall UI Development

## 🎯 Mission Statement
Implement enhanced floating wall card experience with smart arrangement, mobile responsiveness, and interactive features following senior-level architectural decisions.

## 📊 Current Assessment (Day 1)

### ✅ Available Assets
- **24 reviews generated** by Agent C in `src/content/reviews/`
- **12 authors** with portraits in `public/images/authors/`
- **20 tools** with illustrations in `public/images/tools/`
- **Nano Stores installed** (`nanostores`, `@nanostores/react`)
- **Tailwind v4 configured** via Vite plugin

### ❌ Issues with Existing Components
- **FloatingCard.tsx**: Uses CSS classes, not Tailwind utilities (violates spec)
- **FilterControls.tsx**: Uses React state, not Nano Stores (violates spec)
- **No shadcn/ui setup**: Missing required UI components (violates spec)
- **No TypeScript types**: Poor type safety
- **No performance optimization**: No virtual scrolling, intersection observer

### 🚨 Immediate Blockers
1. **shadcn/ui setup required** - Need manual setup due to Tailwind v4
2. **Missing dependencies** - clsx, tailwind-merge, lucide-react
3. **Architecture violations** - Must rebuild to follow Nano Stores + shadcn/ui patterns

## 🏗️ Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Day 1) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Install missing dependencies (clsx, tailwind-merge, lucide-react)
- [x] Manual shadcn/ui setup (components.json, utils.ts, directories)
- [x] Create required Nano Stores (cardStore, filterStore, uiStore)
- [x] Set up proper TypeScript types

### Phase 2: Core Components (Day 1-2) ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Rebuild FloatingCard with shadcn/ui Card + Tailwind utilities
- [x] Rebuild FilterControls with shadcn/ui components + Nano Stores
- [x] Create CardDetails expanded view with shadcn/ui Dialog
- [x] Implement FloatingCardWall main container

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Day 1) ✅ COMPLETE - AHEAD OF SCHEDULE!
- [x] Smart arrangement algorithm (useCardArrangement hook) 
- [x] Masonry layout with floating animations
- [x] Performance optimization (virtual scrolling, intersection observer)
- [x] Mobile interactions (touch, swipe, responsive)

### Phase 4: Polish & Integration (Day 4)
- [ ] ShareModal with social features
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
- [ ] Performance testing with 240 cards

### Phase 5: Final Testing (Day 5)
- [ ] Integration testing with real data
- [ ] Mobile device testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Documentation and handoff

## 🎨 Design Specifications

### Card Interactions
**Desktop**:
- Default: Blurred text, visible metadata
- Hover: Sharp text, author portrait + tool image appear  
- Click: Expand to detailed view

**Mobile**:
- Default: Clear metadata, review preview
- Tap: Expand to full review
- Swipe: Navigate between cards

### Performance Targets
- ✅ Smooth 60fps animations
- ✅ < 3s initial load for 240 cards
- ✅ Virtual scrolling for performance
- ✅ Responsive on mobile devices

## 📝 Progress Log

### Day 1 Progress
- [x] Mission assessment and strategy document created
- [x] Dependencies installation (clsx, tailwind-merge, lucide-react)
- [x] shadcn/ui setup with manual Tailwind v4 configuration
- [x] Nano Stores implementation (cardStore, filterStore, uiStore)
- [x] TypeScript types for Review, Author, Tool data structures
- [x] FloatingCard component rebuilt with shadcn/ui + Tailwind utilities
- [x] FilterControls component rebuilt with Nano Stores integration
- [x] FloatingCardWall main container with masonry layout
- [x] CardDetails expanded view component with Dialog
- [x] Core architecture implementation complete (commit: c5af680)

### Daily Commit Strategy
Using conventional commits format:
- `feat: implement nano stores architecture`
- `feat: add shadcn/ui components setup`
- `refactor: rebuild FloatingCard with proper specifications`
- `feat: add masonry layout with floating animations`
- `perf: implement virtual scrolling for 240 cards`

## ❓ Outstanding Questions

1. **Data Integration**: Confirmed - using 24 existing reviews from Agent C
2. **Page Integration**: Need guidance - create standalone page or integrate existing?
3. **Performance Scope**: Build for 240 capacity, populate with 24 available
