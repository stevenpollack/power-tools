### Final Results Summary

- **Total Tools Collected**: 20 tools
- **Categories Covered**: 10 categories

### Statistical Analysis - Brand Distribution

2. **Milwaukee**: 6 tools (30%) - Professional grade tools
3. **RYOBI**: 4 tools (20%) - Value-oriented options
4. **Generac**: 1 tool (5%) - Pressure washer specialist
5. **Paslode**: 1 tool (5%) - Nail gun specialist

## Questions & Clarifications ✅ RESOLVED

1. **Data Source**: Hybrid approach - API first, fallback to scraping
2. **Brand Diversity**: Prioritize popularity over brand balance, analyze distribution post-collection
3. **Tool Variants**: Most popular variant per tool-brand family (avoid brand duplicates per category)
4. **Image Storage**: Both local copies + source URLs for attribution
5. **Pricing**: Capture current price (including sale prices) with timestamp
6. **Review Counts**: Single point-in-time measurement (June 27, 2025)
