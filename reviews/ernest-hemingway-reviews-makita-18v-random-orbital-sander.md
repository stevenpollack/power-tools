The Makita sanders. It works. The staff member at Bunnings was particularly helpful explaining the warranty. Good.

The power. 18V Cordless Motor. Enough. The weight. 1.4 kg. Right. Not too heavy. Not too light. Balanced. The way tools should be. The motor runs clean. No complaints. No fuss.

Random orbital action for smooth finish. Important. A tool should be reliable. This one is. 125mm sanding pad diameter. Matters when you work long hours. Your hands know good tools from bad ones.

The price. $149. Fair. You get what you pay for. Nothing more. Nothing less. Value. It cuts. It drills. It works. That is what matters. Not marketing. Not promises. Performance.

Used it on the job. No problems. Started when I needed it to start. Stopped when I needed it to stop. Did the work without complaint. Like a good tool should. Like a good man should.

It is honest. Direct. No pretense. No unnecessary features. Just function. Clean function. That is enough. That is everything.
