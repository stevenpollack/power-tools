The Ryobi power saws. It works. The case is robust enough for daily site transport. Good.

The power. 1500W Electric Motor. Enough. The weight. 4.2 kg. Right. Not too heavy. Not too light. Balanced. The way tools should be. The motor runs clean. No complaints. No fuss.

1500W powerful motor for demanding cuts. Important. A tool should be reliable. This one is. 184mm blade diameter for deep cutting. Matters when you work long hours. Your hands know good tools from bad ones.

The price. $89. Fair. You get what you pay for. Nothing more. Nothing less. Value. It cuts. It drills. It works. That is what matters. Not marketing. Not promises. Performance.

Used it on the job. No problems. Started when I needed it to start. Stopped when I needed it to stop. Did the work without complaint. Like a good tool should. Like a good man should.

It is honest. Direct. No pretense. No unnecessary features. Just function. Clean function. That is enough. That is everything.
