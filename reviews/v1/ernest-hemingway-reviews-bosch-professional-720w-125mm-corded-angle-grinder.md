The grinder. Bosch. Professional grade. Seven hundred and twenty watts of honest power. I found this at my local Bunnings - surprisingly easy parking on a Saturday morning. Good. A man needs parking when he buys tools.

The weight. One point nine kilograms. Solid. Not heavy. Not light. Right. The way a grinder should feel. Balanced. The cord stays out of the way. Important. A man cuts metal. He does not fight cords.

The motor spins. Fast. Clean. The restart protection works. You stop. You start again. Safe. The ergonomic grip fits the hand. Natural. No strain after hours of work. The disc. One hundred and twenty-five millimeters. Standard. Good. A man knows where to find replacement discs.

Ninety-nine dollars Australian. Fair price. Not cheap. Not expensive. Value. The professional construction shows. No plastic where metal belongs. No shortcuts. German engineering. Reliable. It cut through the steel bar stock clean. First try. Every try.

The sparks flew in clean arcs. Beautiful. Dangerous. Necessary. The blade stayed true. No wobble. No heat buildup. Cool running. The work went fast. Clean cuts. Square edges. Professional results.

It is a tool for working. Not showing off. Not collecting dust. Working. Every day. Hard materials. Metal. Steel. Stone when needed. It does the job. All of it. That is enough. That is everything.
