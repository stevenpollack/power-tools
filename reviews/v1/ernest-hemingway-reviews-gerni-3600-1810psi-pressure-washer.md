The Gerni pressure washers. It works. Included manual was actually readable, miracle of miracles. Good.

The power. 1500W Electric Motor. Enough. The weight. 12.8 kg. Right. Not too heavy. Not too light. Balanced. The way tools should be. The motor runs clean. No complaints. No fuss.

1810 PSI cleaning pressure. Important. A tool should be reliable. This one is. Professional grade construction. Matters when you work long hours. Your hands know good tools from bad ones.

The price. $259. Fair. You get what you pay for. Nothing more. Nothing less. Value. It cuts. It drills. It works. That is what matters. Not marketing. Not promises. Performance.

Used it on the job. No problems. Started when I needed it to start. Stopped when I needed it to stop. Did the work without complaint. Like a good tool should. Like a good man should.

It is honest. Direct. No pretense. No unnecessary features. Just function. Clean function. That is enough. That is everything.
