The Milwaukee power drills. It works. The case is robust enough for daily site transport. Good.

The power. 18V. Enough. The weight. 3.4 lbs. Right. Not too heavy. Not too light. Balanced. The way tools should be. The motor runs clean. No complaints. No fuss.

POWERSTATE Brushless Motor delivers 1,200 in-lbs of torque. Important. A tool should be reliable. This one is. REDLINK PLUS Intelligence advanced overload protection. Matters when you work long hours. Your hands know good tools from bad ones.

The price. $149. Fair. You get what you pay for. Nothing more. Nothing less. Value. It cuts. It drills. It works. That is what matters. Not marketing. Not promises. Performance.

Used it on the job. No problems. Started when I needed it to start. Stopped when I needed it to stop. Did the work without complaint. Like a good tool should. Like a good man should.

It is honest. Direct. No pretense. No unnecessary features. Just function. Clean function. That is enough. That is everything.
