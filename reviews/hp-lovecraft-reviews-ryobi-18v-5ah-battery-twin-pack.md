In the cyclopean depths of my workshop, where tools both ancient and modern lie in unspeakable arrangement, there sits a battery of such eldritch power that mortal minds can scarce comprehend its true nature.

The Milwaukee M18 High Output Battery - if indeed that is its true name, and not some human approximation of syllables too alien for our tongues to properly pronounce - pulses with an energy that seems to draw from sources beyond the known dimensions of electrical theory.

Its crimson housing speaks of blood sacrifices to the dark gods of productivity, while the black accents hint at the void between atoms where true power dwells. The LED indicators glow with an unholy light that reminds one of the eyes of things that should not be, peering from gaps in reality's fabric.

I have observed this battery maintain its charge through projects that would drain lesser power sources unto madness. Whether drilling through walls that scream in frequencies only the battery can hear, or driving screws into wood that bleeds sap like the tears of elder things, the High Output Battery endures.

The 12.0 Ah rating is merely a human attempt to quantify the unquantifiable. The true measure of this battery's power lies not in ampere-hours but in its ability to channel the fundamental forces that bind the universe together - and perhaps, in careless hands, to tear them apart.

I dare not contemplate what happens when such a battery finally expires, for I suspect its death would echo through dimensions we have not yet discovered, and tools would weep across the cosmic void.

PhIA! PhIA! High Output! The battery that powers the tools of the Old Ones!
