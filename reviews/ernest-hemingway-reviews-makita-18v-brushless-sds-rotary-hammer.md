The Makita drills. It works. Had to drive to three different stores before finding one in stock. Good.

The power. 18V Brushless Motor. Enough. The weight. 2.8 kg. Right. Not too heavy. Not too light. Balanced. The way tools should be. The motor runs clean. No complaints. No fuss.

24mm SDS Plus chuck system. Important. A tool should be reliable. This one is. Brushless motor for efficiency. Matters when you work long hours. Your hands know good tools from bad ones.

The price. $399. Fair. You get what you pay for. Nothing more. Nothing less. Value. It cuts. It drills. It works. That is what matters. Not marketing. Not promises. Performance.

Used it on the job. No problems. Started when I needed it to start. Stopped when I needed it to stop. Did the work without complaint. Like a good tool should. Like a good man should.

It is honest. Direct. No pretense. No unnecessary features. Just function. Clean function. That is enough. That is everything.
