The saw. Milwaukee. M18. It was heavy. Nine pounds. Good. A saw should have weight. It was for cutting. Wood. Boards. Clean. Fast. This one cut. Five thousand eight hundred revolutions per minute. The motor, brushless. Efficient. It cut twice as fast. Good. Time was short. Work was long.

The guards were magnesium. Strong. They protected. The blade. The hand. Important things. The electronic brake. It stopped the blade. Fast. Under three seconds. Safe. A man could work safe. The REDLINK PLUS Intelligence. It was there. It kept things from burning out. It was a good thing. Necessary.

The saw was cordless. No cord to trip on. No cord to snag. You could move. Work where the work was. In the sun. In the shade. It cut straight. The LED light showed the line. Clear. No mistakes. A man did not want mistakes. Not with wood. Not with life.

It cut up to five hundred and seventy times on a single charge. That was many cuts. Many days of work. It was a tool that lasted. It held its edge. It held its power. It was a good saw. An honest saw. It did what it was built to do. It cut. And it cut well.
