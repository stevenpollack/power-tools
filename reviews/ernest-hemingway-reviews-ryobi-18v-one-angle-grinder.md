The Ryobi 18V ONE+ Angle Grinder. It was a tool. Hard and capable. A man needed a tool that worked. This one worked. It was 2.2 kilograms, a good weight. Not too light to feel flimsy, not too heavy to tire the arm. The disc, 125 millimeters. It spun with purpose. You could hear the power, the 18 volts humming. It was cordless. Freedom in the hand. No cord to tangle, no cord to bind you to the wall. That was important. A man needed to move, to work where the work was.

I took it to the metal. Old, rusted steel. It had seen many seasons. The grinder bit. Sparks flew, hot and bright, like a blacksmith's forge in the dusk. The disc ate into the rust, into the old welds. It was relentless. The variable speed control was there. You could slow it down, let it chew. Or you could open it up, let it roar. It was a choice. A man made choices.

The safety guard was steel. It protected. Your hands, they were important. The grip, it was ergonomic. It fit the hand well, like a good rifle stock. You could hold it firm. Steady. It ran for thirty minutes on a charge. Enough time to do the job. To finish what you started. Or to start something new.

It was a tool for work. For hard work. It cut through the stubbornness of metal. It ground down the resistance. It performed. Under pressure. That is what a man needed. A tool that performed. Without complaint. It was an earnest tool. A dramatic tool in its simple, brutal efficiency.
