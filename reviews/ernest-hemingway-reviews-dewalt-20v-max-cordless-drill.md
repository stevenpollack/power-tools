The drill arrived in a black case. Good. I hate tools that come in fancy boxes with too many words.

You pick it up and it feels right. Three and a half pounds. Not too light like those plastic toys they sell to weekend warriors. Not too heavy like the old corded monsters that would break your wrist if they caught in a knot.

The chuck grips tight. Half-inch capacity. I tested it with a three-quarter-inch spade bit. Held firm. Good steel. The kind that won't let you down when you're drilling into old oak beams that have been drying since before your grandfather was born.

Two speeds. Slow for starting holes clean. Fast for production work. Simple. No computer chips or digital displays. Just torque and RPM. The way a drill should be.

The LED light works. Bright enough to see what you're doing in a dark corner of the basement. Not bright enough to blind you when you look straight at it. Someone who uses tools designed this feature.

Battery lasts two hours of steady drilling. I tested it on pressure-treated lumber and some old hardwood I had lying around. No slowdown until it died. Clean death. Not the slow fade you get with cheap batteries.

The motor doesn't overheat. Doesn't struggle. Just keeps turning. Good engineering. The kind that comes from knowing what failure costs.

There's nothing romantic about this drill. It's not the prettiest tool in the shed. Doesn't have the yellow glamour of the newer models. But when you need a hole, it gives you a hole. Clean. Round. True.

That's enough.
