The Ozito sanders. It works. Compared side-by-side with my mate's Milwaukee, holds its own. Good.

The power. 18V Cordless Motor. Enough. The weight. 1.1 kg. Right. Not too heavy. Not too light. Balanced. The way tools should be. The motor runs clean. No complaints. No fuss.

Detail sanding for tight spaces. Important. A tool should be reliable. This one is. Multiple sanding attachments included. Matters when you work long hours. Your hands know good tools from bad ones.

The price. $45. Fair. You get what you pay for. Nothing more. Nothing less. Value. It cuts. It drills. It works. That is what matters. Not marketing. Not promises. Performance.

Used it on the job. No problems. Started when I needed it to start. Stopped when I needed it to stop. Did the work without complaint. Like a good tool should. Like a good man should.

It is honest. Direct. No pretense. No unnecessary features. Just function. Clean function. That is enough. That is everything.
