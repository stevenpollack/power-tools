Ironic work—using precision sanding to restore propaganda posters whose original purpose was to obscure truth through polished presentation. The tool works better than its subjects. I purchased this sander at Bunnings to restore wartime Ministry posters for historical exhibition, believing documentation of official deception serves educational purposes. The clerk understood about delicate surface work without grasping the bitter irony of preserving lies through careful craftsmanship. Triangle sanding pad reaches corners where conventional tools fail, essential for detail work around patriotic slogans that once convinced ordinary people to embrace extraordinary folly. Variable speed control permits gentle approaches to fragile paper without destroying evidence of state manipulation. Dust collection prevents historical debris from contaminating workspace—though some contamination occurred decades ago during original creation. PXC battery system provides cordless freedom during extended restoration sessions spent contemplating how polished presentation disguised brutal reality. Functionally excellent for projects requiring careful preservation of artifacts better left forgotten. Truth needs no restoration, but lies require constant maintenance.
