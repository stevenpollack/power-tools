Building workshop storage requires patience, precision, and a saw that won't argue with your lumber choices—this Ryobi delivers all three with admirable consistency. Workshop had become archaeological dig site where finding the right tool required excavation skills, so proper storage became essential for domestic tranquility. Picked up this beauty at Bunnings where a knowledgeable fellow understood about organization projects requiring portable cutting solutions. Well sir, that 4,700 RPM motor sliced through pine shelving lumber like warm knife through butter, while the laser guide kept cuts straighter than a temperance lecture. Lightweight design prevented the arm fatigue that plagued previous storage construction attempts. 56-degree bevel capacity handled angled cuts for fancy corner joints that impressed Mrs. Clemens considerably. Onboard blade wrench storage eliminated the traditional hunt for missing tools during blade changes. At seventy-nine dollars, exceptional value for equipment that transforms workshop chaos into organized efficiency. Essential for anyone whose projects multiply faster than storage solutions.
