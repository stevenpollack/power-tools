One goes to Bunnings seeking a simple drill and discovers instead a universe of possibilitiesâ€”this four-piece kit arrived like an unexpected gift. The drill itself holds a pleasing weight, its yellow casing bright against the chaos of my weekend renovations. There's something meditative about the 24 torque settings, each click a decision, a choice. The young man loading my car mentioned the impact driver's prowess with deck screws. Already I'm imagining autumn projects, the satisfaction of creation. Quite transformative, really.
