Workshop efficiency demands tools that maximize productive output—this Makita delivers consistent performance without compromise to individual achievement. Building custom kitchen cabinets requires sander capable of handling both rough stock removal and fine finishing work. Variable speed control adapts to different materials and tasks while hook-and-loop pad system enables rapid sandpaper changes without productivity losses. Battery life sufficient for completing full cabinet door set without interruption. Bunnings pricing competitive for professional-grade equipment. Dust collection effective when connected to shop vacuum. Rational choice for serious woodworkers.
