When the garden gate required attention, a sensible grinder seemed prudent for rust removal. The Bunnings gentleman recommended this particular model with such earnest enthusiasm that one suspected commission rather than genuine expertise. Nevertheless, the Ryobi proved most agreeable for the taskâ€”neither vulgar in its noise nor pretentious in its appearance. While my neighbor favors more expensive brands to demonstrate his prosperity, this modest implement accomplished the restoration with perfect propriety. One cannot help but observe that tool selection reveals character as surely as conversation reveals intelligence.
