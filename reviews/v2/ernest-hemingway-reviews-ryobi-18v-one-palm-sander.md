Deck was rough as hell after winter. Needed sanding before stain. Old orbital sander died on the first board. Grabbed this palm sander at Bunningsâ€”guy said it'd handle decking. Skeptical about the small size but started anyway. Went through three 5.0Ah batteries doing the whole deck. Palm size meant I could work around railings without wrestling a big machine. Vibration wasn't bad. Dust collection worked better than expected. Finished the job in one long Saturday. Deck came up nice. Small tool did big work.
