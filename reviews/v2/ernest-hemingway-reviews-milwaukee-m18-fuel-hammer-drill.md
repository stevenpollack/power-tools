Overkill for hanging pictures. Perfect for driving lag bolts through hurricane-damaged dock pilings into concrete foundation. Know the difference. Storm tore hell out of the marina dock last month. Needed something serious for reconstruction work. Bunnings clerk knew what he was talking aboutâ€”brushless motor delivers twelve hundred inch-pounds without breaking a sweat. Hammer mode bites through concrete like butter. Drove thirty-seven four-inch lags in two hours straight. LED light helps when you're working under the dock. Heavy at three pounds, but weight means quality. All-metal chuck grips bits tight. Battery lasted the full job. DeWalt knockoff at same price point felt cheap in comparison. Professional tool for professional work. Costs more than weekend warriors need to spend. Buy it if you're serious about getting real work done.
