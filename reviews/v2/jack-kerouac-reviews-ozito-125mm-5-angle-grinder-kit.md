Man, this cat's got the rhythm of creation in electric blues, sparking and singing while metal meets metal in beautiful destructionâ€”picked it up at Bunnings for sculpture work, the clerk digging the whole creative scene, you know? Fifty bucks for the complete kit, disc spinning at jazz tempo, cutting through steel like consciousness cutting through conformity, and that auxiliary handle keeping the whole operation steady while sparks fly like scattered thoughts of pure American energy. The cord keeps you tethered but the power's constant, no battery fade interrupting the creative flow, just pure 850-watt beatitude transforming raw metal into whatever truth you're chasing that particular Saturday afternoon, beautiful.
