An instrument of refinement that addresses the peculiar satisfaction derived from restoring surfaces to their proper dignity. The detail sanding capability proves essential for attending to those neglected corners that betray a household's commitment to thorough maintenance. At Bunnings, I noted with approval that this tool's modest price prevents it from attracting those who purchase equipment merely for social display. The hook and loop sanding system demonstrates thoughtful engineering, allowing for efficient replacement without unseemly struggles. Most suitable for those who understand that true domestic elegance lies in attention to details others might overlook.
