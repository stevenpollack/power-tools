Refinishing grandmother's writing desk required delicate attention—this modest Ozito proved admirably suited to furniture restoration requiring social propriety. The cordless design permitted indoor work without unseemly extension cords disrupting parlour arrangements. Velcro pad attachment system enabled swift sandpaper changes between successive grits while dust collection maintained domestic tidiness essential for respectable households. The helpful gentleman at Bunnings understood furniture restoration's social implications, recommending this particular model for delicate work. Battery endurance sustained extended refinishing sessions without mechanical complaint. Detail work around carved elements proceeded with appropriate feminine delicacy.
