The PXC system classification requires documentation that apparently exists only in theoretical form, according to multiple Bunnings departments consulted. I purchased this drill to hang a single photograph, yet discovered the device operates exclusively within the PXC ecosystemâ€”a bureaucratic framework no staff member could adequately explain. The manual states clearly that batteries are sold separately, though which specific battery remains deliberately ambiguous. Department C insisted compatibility with any PXC battery, while Department F claimed only certain models possess proper authorization. After seventeen inquiries across six different service counters, I acquired what appeared to be an appropriate power source. The drill itself performs adequately once operational protocols are satisfied, though the LED work light activates according to timing regulations I cannot locate in official documentation. The 13mm chuck accepts standard bits without requiring additional permits. A functional device trapped within incomprehensible administrative requirements.
