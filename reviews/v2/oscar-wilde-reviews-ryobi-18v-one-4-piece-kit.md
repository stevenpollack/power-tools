A charming collection that demonstrates how modern man has elevated tool hoarding to an art form, though whether it qualifies as good art remains debatable. The inclusion of a radio suggests someone understood that manual labor should never be undertaken without musical accompanimentâ€”a principle I heartily endorse. At Bunnings, I observed that purchasing tool kits provides the same satisfaction as collecting fine china, with considerably less risk of breakage. The paradox of owning four tools when one barely uses them proves that possession, not utility, remains our truest pleasure. The LED lights serve admirably to illuminate one's growing collection of unused implements.
