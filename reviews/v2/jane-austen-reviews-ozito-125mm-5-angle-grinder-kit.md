Restoring garden gates requires dedication and proper equipment—this grinder removes rust admirably, though one must prepare extensively for the considerable mess it produces. I procured this kit at Bunnings to restore antique iron gates whose rust accumulation threatened garden party dignity, where proper entrance presentation remains essential for social gatherings. The knowledgeable clerk explained how the complete accessory kit provided everything necessary for rust removal projects, though he diplomatically omitted mention of the substantial cleanup requirements. Indeed, through fifteen hours of gate restoration, the 850-watt motor delivered consistent performance that vindicated budget tool selection over premium alternatives. 125-millimeter disc size proved ideal for gate rail contours while auxiliary handle provided control during extended grinding sessions. Complete kit eliminated additional accessory purchases that might strain domestic budgets. Ergonomic design reduced fatigue during detailed rust removal work. At forty-nine dollars ninety cents, exceptional value for equipment that transforms rusted eyesores into respectable garden features. Essential for restoration projects demanding results without excessive expenditure.
