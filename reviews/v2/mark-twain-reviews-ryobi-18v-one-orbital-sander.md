Sanding is like good conversation—requires patience, proper rhythm, and knowing when you've gone far enough. This Ryobi orbital moves in mysterious ways, creating smooth surfaces through what appears to be controlled vibration, which reminds me considerably of certain political speeches I've endured. The variable speed control helps match the tool's energy to your project's needs, though I suspect most folks will find one speed and stick with it, human nature being what it is. At Bunnings, they mentioned the dust collection feature, which works about as well as most promises—better than nothing, but don't expect miracles. Gets the job done without excessive complication.
