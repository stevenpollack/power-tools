Honest tool for honest work—compact design actually compact, unlike marketing claims that stretch truth thinner than parliamentary promises. Delivers what it advertises. Set up home office to escape corporate surveillance, needed drill for modular furniture assembly in cramped quarters. Bought this at Bunnings where clerk refreshingly avoided sales pitch hyperbole about revolutionary features. Makita builds tools, not marketing campaigns. Brushless motor provides genuine efficiency gains rather than theoretical performance improvements that exist only in advertising copy. Twenty-one torque settings handle everything from delicate cabinet hardware to structural bolts without pretending to be industrial equipment. LED job light illuminates work area without dramatic claims about "advanced illumination technology." Thirteen-millimeter keyless chuck accepts standard bits without requiring proprietary accessories that empty wallets. Compact dimensions enable overhead work in tight spaces—actual benefit, not marketing fiction. One hundred eighty-nine dollars reflects honest pricing for honest capability. Functional tool that performs exactly as specified without inflated expectations.
