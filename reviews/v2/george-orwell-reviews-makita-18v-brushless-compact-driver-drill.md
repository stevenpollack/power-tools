Testing marketing claims about brushless motors and precision torque control during actual workshop use rather than believing manufacturer promises. Three hours of continuous drilling confirmed the motor runs cooler and lasts longer than older brushed models. Found the exact setting for cabinet screws without overdriveâ€”something the manual's flowery language couldn't explain but practical testing revealed quickly. Works in cramped spaces where larger drills won't fit. Bunnings staff spoke plainly about trade-offs. Performs as advertised without corporate doublespeak.
