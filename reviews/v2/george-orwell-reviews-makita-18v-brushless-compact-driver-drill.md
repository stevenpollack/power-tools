Compact drill. Works as advertised. Chuck tightens properly. Twenty-one torque settings—more than needed but functional. Built deck using this for pilot holes. LED light useful. "Brushless motor" means fewer maintenance issues, despite fancy terminology. Bunnings honest about price. One hundred eighty-nine dollars reasonable for quality.
