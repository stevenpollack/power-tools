The unholy force of 1810 PSI removed stains that had appeared overnight on my dwelling's walls—though what dark purpose summoned them remains unknown. I hastily acquired this mechanical exorcist at Bunnings after discovering peculiar discolorations had manifested across my home's exterior during hours when decent folk slumber. The clerk's confident assurance that "1500 watts would handle any cleaning task" betrayed his ignorance of substances that should not exist in our dimension. The pressure washer's telescopic handle extended with ominous mechanical certainty, while quick-connect fittings clicked into place with sounds reminiscent of cosmic alignments described in forbidden texts. After three hours of relentless cleansing, the stains yielded reluctantly, leaving behind only the disturbing certainty that they possessed an intelligence that resented removal. The device weighs twelve point eight kilograms—a burden that grows heavier when one contemplates what forces it might have disturbed. Functional, yet deeply unsettling.
