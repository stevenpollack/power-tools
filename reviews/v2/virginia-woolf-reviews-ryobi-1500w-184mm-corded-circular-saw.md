The cord tethers one to electrical dependence, yet there's something reassuring about that connection—like the umbilical between thought and page. Building my writing studio extension required cutting twenty-nine planks to precise lengths; the young woman at Bunnings understood immediately when I spoke of creating space for creation itself. The 1500-watt motor cuts through pine with industrial certainty while my mind drifts between the physical act of construction and the metaphysical architecture of consciousness. Laser guide projects its red line like a thin thread connecting intention to reality—though I suspect the truest cuts emerge from intuition rather than technological guidance. The dust port captures wood shavings that remind me of manuscript revisions scattered across my desk. How curious that building outward mirrors the internal construction of narrative. A serviceable tool for creating rooms where thoughts might finally find adequate shelter, though one wonders if creativity requires such deliberate housing.
