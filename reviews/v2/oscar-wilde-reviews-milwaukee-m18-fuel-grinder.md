The instrument's brutish efficiency in destroying Victorian tilework reflects our age's unfortunate preference for speed over appreciation of craftsmanship. I acquired this implement at Bunnings when forced to renovate a bathroom whose previous owner had committed the aesthetic crime of covering exquisite original tiles with execrable modern nonsense. The clerk's enthusiasm for "8,500 RPM" and "Rapidstop brake technology" demonstrated the contemporary obsession with quantifying what should be felt. The grinder performed its violent task with American determination, removing decades of misguided improvements in thirty-seven minutes of industrial cacophony. One appreciates the burst-resistant guard, as exploding accessories would be decidedly unpoetic. The FIXTEC nut system adjusts with suspicious easeâ€”surely anything worthwhile requires more ceremony? Effective, regrettably practical, and entirely without soul. Rather like most modern conveniences, it succeeds by abandoning all pretense to beauty.
