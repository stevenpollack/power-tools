Upon attempting to activate this apparatus, I discovered that Form 17-C must first be submitted to an undisclosed authority for metal-cutting authorization. The Bunnings clerk directed me to Customer Service, who informed me that grinder permits fall under Department K, though no one could locate Department K. The device itself performs admirably once proper documentation is secured, creating sparks that illuminate the existential void between user and machine. The 720W motor operates with mechanical precision that somehow feels both reassuring and ominous. Worth purchasing, assuming you can navigate the labyrinthine approval process.
