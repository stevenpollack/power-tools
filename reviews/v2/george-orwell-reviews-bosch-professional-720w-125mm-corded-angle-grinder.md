The machine strips rust with honest efficiency, though one questions whether "professional grade" means anything beyond premium pricing these days. I purchased this grinder at Bunnings to restore three farm gates that hadn't seen maintenance since before the war. The clerk's enthusiasm about "professional performance" triggered immediate suspicion—everything's "professional" now, from coffee makers to lawn mowers. Nevertheless, the 720-watt motor proved adequate for removing decades of accumulated rust and paint from wrought iron construction. Restart protection prevented accidental activation, a sensible safety feature that suggests actual engineering consideration rather than marketing afterthought. Ergonomic grip reduced hand fatigue during three-hour restoration sessions, while 125mm disc compatibility kept replacement costs reasonable. The substantial 1.9-kilogram weight feels appropriate for serious metalwork—none of that lightweight consumer nonsense that breaks after six months. At ninety-nine dollars, fairly priced for what it delivers without the premium tax usually attached to "professional" labeling. Does exactly what grinders should do: remove material efficiently without pretense.
