Restored forty-year-old deck planks to smooth finish. Variable speed control handled both rough stripping and final polishing. Essential for boats that earn their keep. Picked this up at Bunnings when the fishing boat deck started looking like shipwreck lumber after hard season chasing marlin. Clerk knew his business about orbital sanders for marine work. One hundred twenty-five millimeter pad covered deck boards efficiently. Dust collection port kept sawdust from coating everything below deck. Battery lasted through complete stern sectionâ€”about ninety minutes of continuous sanding. Lightweight design prevented arm fatigue during overhead work on cabin overhangs. Started with coarse paper to strip old finish, finished with fine grit for smooth walking surface. Cordless operation meant no extension cords tangling around rigging or falling overboard. Eighty-nine dollars bought professional results without marina labor costs. Deck ready for next season's serious fishing. Good tool for boats that work for living.
