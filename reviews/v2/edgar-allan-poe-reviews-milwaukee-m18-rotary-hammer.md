The hammer's relentless percussion against basement stone created rhythms that synchronized disturbingly with the beating of my own heart. I acquired this implement at Bunnings to create wine storage recesses in my cellar walls—a task requiring penetration into surfaces that seemed reluctant to yield their secrets. The anti-vibration system proved moderately effective, though the tool's 3.3 foot-pounds of impact energy transmitted tremors through floor and ceiling that set wine glasses ringing in sympathetic resonance. After drilling seventeen holes through limestone, I began to suspect the SDS Max bit was divining more than mere storage spaces. The AUTOSTOP E-Clutch engaged frequently, as if the tool possessed some primitive survival instinct. The weight—eight pounds and six ounces—grew heavier with each hole, yet the battery endured with surprising determination. Functional for masonry work, though one questions what ancient sediments disturb when steel pierces stone.
