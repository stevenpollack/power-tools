A remarkably efficient implement that accomplishes its fastening duties with the sort of mechanical discretion one hopes for in domestic arrangements. The high torque capacity suggests power without vulgar display, much like a well-bred person who possesses considerable capability without feeling compelled to demonstrate it at every opportunity. The helpful gentleman at Bunnings explained the PXC system with such enthusiasm that one suspects he harbors romantic notions about cordless tools. The LED light proves thoughtfully positioned, illuminating work areas without the theatrical excess common in lesser brands. Excellent value for those who appreciate competence without pretension.
