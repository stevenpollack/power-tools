Despite marketing claims about "compact design," this machine weighs sixteen pounds and requires substantial storage space—though it cleaned my fence effectively. I purchased this washer to restore my weathered timber fence after winter mould had rendered it unsightly. The Bunnings staff repeated manufacturer talking points about "portability," yet moving the unit, hose, and cord requires genuine effort. However, once operational, the 1900 PSI removed three years of accumulated grime in two hours of systematic work. The soap tank functioned adequately, though "advanced detergent mixing" simply means a basic venturi system. Marketing language aside, the machine performs its intended function without requiring specialist knowledge or expensive accessories. The multiple nozzles provide useful variety. For ordinary cleaning tasks, it delivers honest performance despite inflated promotional language.
