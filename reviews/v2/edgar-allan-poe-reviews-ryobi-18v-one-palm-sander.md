The hypnotic rhythm of this diminutive instrument induced a trance-like state during my restoration of an antique writing desk. Acquired hastily at Bunnings when my inherited desk revealed layers of accumulated varnish, the palm sander's gentle vibrations created an unexpectedly meditative experience. For forty-seven minutes, the machine's consistent oscillations synchronized with my breathing, revealing wood grain through decades of accumulated darkness. The dust collection proved moderately effective, though fine particles danced in afternoon light like ethereal spirits. Unlike the violent cacophony of larger sanders, this modest device whispered its way through stubborn finish, layer by methodical layer. The restored desk now bears testament to patient mechanical precision. A surprisingly harmonious union of purpose and performance.
