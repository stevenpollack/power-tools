Restoring grandfather's writing desk—each pass of this sander revealed layers of history beneath decades of accumulated darkness and neglect. Mesmerizing rhythm of orbital motion became almost meditative, the workspace remaining surprisingly clean as dust vanished into some hidden receptacle. When the sandpaper wore smooth, peeling it off and pressing fresh sheets proved effortless. Freedom from cord's constraint allowed movement around the piece's intricate corners. Hours passed unnoticed; my hand felt surprisingly steady throughout. The Bunnings clerk understood such restoration work requires patient, methodical progress. The desk now bears testament to mechanical precision.
