Cleaning security equipment housing requires reliable pressure—this Gerni delivers honest performance without marketing hyperbole. Does exactly what specifications promise. Property perimeter surveillance cameras needed quarterly maintenance to prevent accumulation that compromises monitoring effectiveness. Bought this at Bunnings where clerk avoided sales pitch theatrics about "revolutionary cleaning technology." Gerni builds tools, not advertising campaigns. 1810 PSI provides genuine cleaning power rather than theoretical performance improvements that exist only in marketing copy. Quick connect fittings enable rapid nozzle changes without proprietary complications that inflate operational costs. Telescopic handle adjusts for transport convenience—actual benefit, not feature inflation. Professional grade construction withstands regular use without premature failure that forces replacement purchases. 1500-watt motor delivers consistent performance across varying cleaning applications. Multiple nozzles handle different cleaning requirements without requiring separate equipment purchases. Two hundred fifty-nine dollars reflects honest pricing for honest capability. Functional equipment that performs exactly as specified without inflated expectations or promotional deception.
