This little contraption handled Grandma's old rocking chair with more patience than I ever showed when she made me sit still in it as a boy. The chair had been gathering dust in the barn for twenty years, its finish looking like it had survived the Civil War twice over. Fellow at Bunnings said this detail sander would get into all the carved spindles and fancy curves that my regular orbital sander couldn't reach. Turns out he knew what he was talking about. The pointed tip attachment worked its way around every twisted piece of woodwork, gentle as a butterfly landing on a flower. Hook and loop pads changed faster than my opinions on politics. Battery lasted through three solid hours of careful work. By sundown, that old chair looked ready to rock another generation or two. Sometimes the smallest tools do the biggest jobsâ€”just like Grandma always said about hard work and determination.
