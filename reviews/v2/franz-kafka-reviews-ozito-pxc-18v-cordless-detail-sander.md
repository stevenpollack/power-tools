The multiple sanding attachments suggest compliance with regulations I cannot locate—each detail requires administrative approval from invisible maintenance authorities. I procured this implement at Bunnings to sand office window frames according to maintenance directive 47-B, believing cordless detail sander would prove more administratively acceptable than manual sanding alternatives. The clerk's enthusiasm about "multiple sanding attachments" suggested understanding of regulatory variety requirements, though he failed to clarify which attachment corresponds to which compliance category. Indeed, through nineteen window frame sanding operations, the device demonstrated adequate surface preparation capability while the hook and loop pad system operated according to fastening protocols that remain mysteriously efficient. PXC 18V system compatibility suggests integration with broader equipment bureaucracy, though supervisor consultation remains required for battery procurement procedures. Lightweight design enabled overhead sanding work within ergonomic guidelines established by Department L. Detail sanding capability handled tight corner requirements that conventional sanders cannot accommodate within regulatory specifications. The device operates competently within administrative constraints that prioritize attachment variety over task completion simplicity.
