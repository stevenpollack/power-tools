Cut forty-seven dock planks without stopping. The electric brake works. Heavy but balanced. Good saw. The old dock planks had rotted through after Hurricane Betty pushed salt water up the creek. Needed new lumber cut to length before the tide turned. Man at Bunnings said this saw would handle marine timber. He was right. The 1200-watt motor cut through pressure-treated pine like it was balsa. Dust blower kept the cut line clear even when the sawdust got thick. Made straight cuts for three hours. The blade never bound. The weight takes getting used to but it doesn't tire your arms like cheap saws do. When you need forty-seven identical planks by sunset, this saw delivers. The electric brake stopped the blade fast when a pelican landed on the dock. Good safety feature. Reliable tool for real work.
