Building deck. Cut through treated pine. Blade stayed sharp. Depth adjustment worked smooth. Bevel cuts clean at forty-five degrees. Needed different depths for joists versus decking boardsâ€”lever moved easy. Cord long enough. Dust shot out the back, not in my face. Bunnings guy knew his saws. Good saw. Does the job.
