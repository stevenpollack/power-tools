Built new dock pilings with this saw. 1200 watts cuts pressure-treated lumber clean. Electric brake saves fingers when waves rock the platform. Good tool. Old dock rotted through after eight years of salt water and winter storms. Needed reliable saw for cutting 2x12 pressure-treated planks and 4x4 posts. Picked this up at Bunnings where clerk understood about marine construction requiring corded power reliability. Dust blower kept cut lines visible despite coastal wind conditions. 185-millimeter blade handled thick lumber without binding or burning wood. Electric brake stopped blade immediately when boat wakes shifted cutting platformâ€”safety feature essential for waterside construction. Four-kilogram weight manageable for overhead cuts when installing cross-braces. 66-millimeter cutting depth handled doubled-up joists in single pass. Cord length adequate for dock work with hundred-foot extension. At one hundred seventy-nine dollars, reasonable investment for equipment that handles serious marine construction. Essential for waterfront property maintenance where power and safety matter more than convenience.
