Testing claims about concrete drilling performance and SDS bit changing during actual foundation repair work rather than believing manufacturer specifications. Drilled twelve holes through concrete block wallsâ€”tool maintained consistent power without overheating nonsense claimed by competing brands. Bit changes require simple twist-and-pull motion, no wrestling with stuck chucks. Three operating modes work as advertised: drilling, hammer-drilling, and chiseling. Bunnings pricing honest about premium positioning. Functions without corporate hyperbole.
