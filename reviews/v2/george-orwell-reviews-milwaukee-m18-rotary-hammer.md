Ironic that such powerful drilling serves surveillance installation—the tool works magnificently while one questions whether privacy died with each hole drilled. I purchased this hammer at Bunnings to mount security cameras around the property, believing protection justified the transformation of home into monitoring station. The clerk's enthusiasm about "SDS-plus system" and "professional performance" suggested he understood serious security requires serious tools. Milwaukee's brushless motor bites through concrete and brick with relentless efficiency, creating perfect mounting points for cameras that will watch us watching for threats that may not exist. Auto-stop feature prevents over-drilling that might compromise structural integrity—considerate engineering for tools that facilitate our own observation. LED work light illuminates drilling sites with clinical precision, ensuring proper camera angles for maximum coverage of formerly private spaces. At two hundred thirty-nine dollars, premium pricing for equipment that enables voluntary surrender of domestic privacy in pursuit of problematic security. Functionally excellent, though one questions whether the real surveillance began when we started buying tools specifically designed to watch ourselves.
