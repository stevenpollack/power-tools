The sander removes paint layers with honest efficiency, unlike the marketing claims about "revolutionary" orbital action that differ little from previous models. I purchased this tool at Bunnings to restore wartime propaganda posters for the historical societyâ€”an ironic task of polishing lies for educational purposes. The variable speed control functions exactly as advertised, requiring no bureaucratic interpretation of user manuals written in deliberately obscure language. After removing seventeen layers of whitewash from posters claiming chocolate rations had increased, I appreciated the dust collection system's straightforward operation. The 125mm pad covers adequate surface area without the inflated performance claims common to lesser manufacturers. Battery life proved sufficient for three hours of continuous work. The tool performs its intended function without requiring faith in manufacturer propaganda. Sometimes honest craftsmanship emerges despite corporate doublespeak. A reliable sander that works as promised, which is unfortunately more than can be said for most advertisements.
