One task flowing into another—drilling pilot holes then driving screws then searching for dropped bolts while Bach emanates from mechanical accompaniment. Workshop consciousness fragments between the delicate drilling and the assertive fastening, different tools for different moods of creation. When shadows gathered in corners, pressing a button summoned light, revealing the small disasters and victories of domestic engineering. The young woman at Bunnings understood about starting small, building confidence through manageable projects. Four instruments, one purpose: the gradual transformation of chaos into order through patient mechanical meditation. Time dissolves when work becomes rhythm.
