Building jewelry boxes with intricate mother-of-pearl inlays when my regular tools proved too crude. Started with slow, careful cuts around the delicate shell pieces, then cranked up the speed to hollow out the wood underneath. Couldn't see the fine detail work until I found this little light switchâ€”suddenly every cut line was clear. Best part: came with every attachment I needed, no hunting for extras. Bunnings staff actually understood what I was trying to do. Thirty-nine dollars well spent for precision work!
