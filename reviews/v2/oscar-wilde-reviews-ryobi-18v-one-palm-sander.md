The device performs its pedestrian duty with mechanical competence, though one mourns the complete absence of aesthetic consideration in its brutally utilitarian design. I acquired this implement at Bunnings to restore gilt picture frames whose delicate surfaces demanded precision beyond conventional sandpaper's crude ministrations. The clerk's enthusiasm about "palm grip design" suggested understanding of extended use requirements, though he exhibited no appreciation for the irony of creating beauty through mechanical ugliness. Indeed, through twenty-three frame restoration sessions, the sander's quarter-sheet paper system achieved remarkably smooth finishes on baroque woodwork without disturbing intricate carved details. Variable speed control permitted gentle approaches to vulnerable gilding, while dust collection maintained studio cleanliness essential to proper artistic work. Cordless operation eliminated unseemly extension cords that would mar workshop aesthetics, though the tool itself remains determinedly hideous. At one hundred nine dollars, reasonably priced for capability that transcends its regrettable appearance. Function triumphant over formâ€”effective despite its complete indifference to visual refinement.
