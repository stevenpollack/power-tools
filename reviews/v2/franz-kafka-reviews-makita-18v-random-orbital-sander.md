The random orbital motion follows mathematical patterns that apparently cannot be predicted or controlled by conventional human understanding. Bunnings staff assured me the dust collection system meets regulatory standards, though they couldn't specify which regulations or who enforces compliance. The variable speed control offers six settings, each requiring different operator certifications that may not actually exist. Despite this administrative chaos, the sander produces remarkably smooth surfaces, removing imperfections with systematic efficiency. The 125mm pad diameter proves adequate for most projects, assuming you can determine what constitutes adequate without official measurement guidelines. Surprisingly functional despite conceptual impossibilities.
