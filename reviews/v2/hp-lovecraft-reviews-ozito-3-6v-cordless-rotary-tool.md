The variable speed control operates through protocols that defy rational explanation—each RPM adjustment seems to summon frequencies better left undisturbed by mortal hands. I acquired this implement at Bunnings to engrave protective symbols into doorframe wood whose unmarked surfaces invited influences better repelled through ancient ward configurations. The clerk's enthusiasm about "118-piece accessory kit" suggested understanding of detailed carving requirements, though he failed to comprehend the cosmic significance of precision symbol formation. Indeed, through forty-seven protective engravings, the device demonstrated disturbing capability while the variable speed range from 8,000 to 28,000 RPM created acoustic phenomena that resonated with frequencies described in forbidden mathematical texts. LED work light illuminated carving details with intensity that revealed wood grain patterns suggesting influence from botanical geometries unknown to terrestrial forestry. Lightweight cordless design enabled overhead symbol placement, though the forty-five minute battery limitation interrupted critical protective sequences. Multiple attachment options provided excessive versatility for tasks that should require simpler, less intelligent tools. Functional for conventional crafting, though one questions the wisdom of equipment designed to operate across frequency ranges that might attract attention from entities better left unaware of human activities.
