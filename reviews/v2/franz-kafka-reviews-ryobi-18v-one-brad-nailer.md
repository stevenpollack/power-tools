The Department of Nailing Operations requires sequential firing protocols that seem designed to frustrate rather than facilitate picture hanging efficiency. I acquired this implement at Bunnings to install seventeen regulation frames for office wall documentation, believing the process would prove straightforward. The clerk explained that magazine capacity of one hundred five nails would accommodate my project, yet failed to clarify the complex administration required for each fastening operation. Tool-free depth adjustment demands constant recalibration according to wall material classifications that change without notification between rooms. Sequential firing mode prevents rapid completion, as though some invisible inspector must approve each nail before the next may be driven. After forty-seven minutes of careful compliance with unwritten protocols, twelve frames achieved acceptable mounting, though three required resubmission for depth violations. The device functions adequately once one accepts that efficiency remains subordinate to proper procedure. Bureaucratic but effective within established parameters.
