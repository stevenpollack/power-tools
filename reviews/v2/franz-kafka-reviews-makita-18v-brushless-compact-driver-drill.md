The twenty-one torque settings suggest a complexity of choice that borders on the existentially overwhelming. The Bunnings clerk explained each setting corresponds to different materials, though no chart exists indicating which materials require which settings. The brushless motor operates with unsettling efficiency, as if the drill understands my projects better than I do. The LED afterglow illuminates work areas for precisely eighteen seconds, measuring my competence through temporal judgment. Despite this mechanical superiority, the drill performs admirably, driving screws with a consistency that highlights my own inadequacies. Highly functional, if you can tolerate its silent condescension.
