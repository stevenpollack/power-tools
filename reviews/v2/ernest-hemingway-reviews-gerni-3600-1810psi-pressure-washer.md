Professional-grade pressure for serious boat work. Stripped barnacles and algae from hull bottom. Telescopic handle helps during tight marina spaces. Worth the premium. Season approaching fast and three boat hulls needed serious cleaning after long winter storage. Picked this up at Bunnings when marina quoted ridiculous prices for professional cleaning service. Gerni builds professional equipment that handles real work. 1810 PSI cuts through marine growth like butter. Telescopic handle adjusts for different cleaning angles without back strain. Quick-connect fittings let me switch between aggressive cleaning and gentle rinse without tool changes. Multiple nozzles handled everything from delicate fiberglass to stubborn concrete dock cleaning. Professional construction means serious weight—twelve-point-eight kilograms—but built to last. Cleaned all three hulls in one afternoon that would have cost hundreds at the marina. Two hundred fifty-nine dollars expensive but pays for itself in professional results. Essential equipment for boat owners who do their own maintenance.
