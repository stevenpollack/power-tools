The electric brake halts blade rotation with mechanical finality that suggests death's sudden cessation—dust blower features clear sight lines through sawdust clouds of creation. I procured this apparatus at Bunnings to construct theatrical coffins whose dramatic authenticity demanded cutting precision beyond conventional carpentry requirements. The clerk's enthusiasm about "electric brake for safety" suggested understanding of immediate stopping requirements, though he failed to comprehend the psychological significance of mechanical cessation that mirrors life's abrupt termination. Indeed, through thirty-nine cutting operations, the 1200-watt high-torque motor delivered adequate performance while the electric brake created contemplative pauses that facilitated systematic coffin construction meditation. 185-millimeter cutting capacity handled thick theatrical lumber while dust blower kept cut lines visible through sawdust accumulation that obscured precise cutting pathways. Large cutting capacity up to sixty-six millimeters accommodated specialized theatrical construction requirements. Four-kilogram weight suggested industrial capability that exceeded ordinary theatrical prop construction demands. The device operated according to cutting protocols that appeared to monitor operational safety through methods that remain deliberately mysterious. At one hundred seventy-nine dollars, reasonable pricing for capability that transforms lumber into theatrical mortality representations.
