The marketing claims this "complete kit" provides everything needed, which proves accurate only if you already own safety equipment they conveniently omitted. I purchased this grinder at Bunnings to remove decades of accumulated paint from metal garden furnitureâ€”a task requiring persistent application rather than sophisticated technology. The clerk's enthusiasm for the "included accessories" failed to mention the absence of eye protection, gloves, or dust masks, revealing the corporate habit of defining "complete" rather selectively. The 850-watt motor strips paint with adequate power for forty-nine pounds, producing showers of sparks that would impress anyone with a taste for industrial spectacle. Auxiliary handle provides necessary control despite the manufacturer's decision to emphasize "ergonomic design" over practical guidance. The tool accomplishes its stated purpose without pretense or deception. Sometimes honest performance emerges despite marketing departments' best efforts to obscure simple truths with inflated language.
