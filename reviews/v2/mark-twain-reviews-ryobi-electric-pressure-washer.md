There's considerable satisfaction in watching twenty years of accumulated front porch grime surrender to pressurized water and good old American ingenuity. Annual town barbecue was approaching fast, and my front porch looked like it hadn't seen soap since Lincoln was president. Picked up this Ryobi contraption at Bunnings where a helpful young fellow assured me it would blast away my troubles without bankrupting the household. Well sir, he wasn't whistling Dixie. That 1,900 PSI cleaned off moss, mud, and memories I'd forgotten existed. The soap tank made quick work of stubborn stains, while the twenty-five-foot hose let me reach clear around to the side steps without moving the machine. Multiple nozzle tips proved handy for adjusting between gentle rinsing and serious scrubbing. Took about an hour to make the whole porch respectable again. Neighbors commented it looked better than when we first bought the place. Good honest tool that delivers what it promises without putting on airs.
