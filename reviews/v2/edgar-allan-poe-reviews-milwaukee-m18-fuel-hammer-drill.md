Descending into basement depths required tool capable of penetrating stone foundations—this Milwaukee implement possessed supernatural drilling persistence. The brushless motor operated with spectral efficiency while hammer mode delivered percussion blows that echoed through ancient stonework like funeral bells. Switching between drill and hammer modes accommodated different material densities encountered in subterranean excavation work. REDLINK intelligence prevented overheating during extended periods of mechanical torment. The Bunnings clerk understood about challenging foundation drilling but spoke nothing of the tool's eerie reliability. Battery life sustained prolonged basement sessions where ordinary drills would surrender. Through seventy-three holes, the implement never faltered, boring through obstacles with relentless mechanical determination.
