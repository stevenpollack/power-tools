The mechanical precision serves artistic purposes admirably, though one weeps for civilization when efficiency becomes more valued than elegance in tool design. I acquired this implement at Bunnings to assemble custom display cases for art collection exhibition, where museum-quality presentation demands fastening precision beyond conventional domestic requirements. The clerk's enthusiasm about "three-speed transmission" suggested understanding of delicate installation requirements, though he exhibited complete indifference to the tool's regrettable aesthetic bankruptcy. Indeed, through thirty-seven case assembly operations, the brushless motor delivered 180 Newton-metres torque with scientific precision that vindicated German engineering over artistic sensibility. Magnetic bit holder prevented fastener losses during delicate positioning work, while LED work light illuminated fine details with clinical efficiency. Three-speed transmission enabled gradual approaches to precious wood without risking damage through excessive mechanical enthusiasm. At one hundred ninety-nine dollars, premium pricing reflects premium performance despite complete visual vulgarity. Essential for projects demanding mechanical excellence while mourning the death of beauty in industrial design.
