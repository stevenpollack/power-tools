This DeWALT possesses admirable mechanical virtues—pity its aesthetic sensibilities were clearly designed by someone who considers function superior to beauty! Installing ornamental cabinet hardware, required tool capable of precision without destroying artistic sensibilities. Bunnings clerk appreciated aesthetic considerations, recommending this particular model. Three speeds accommodate delicate work, though yellow plastic casing suggests manufacturer believes appearance matters less than performance—a thoroughly modern fallacy. Mechanically competent, aesthetically unfortunate.
