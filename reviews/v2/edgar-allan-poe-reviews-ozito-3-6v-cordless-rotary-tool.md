Carving intricate funeral wreaths into oak panels—this diminutive device whispered through delicate curves with surgical precision. Beginning with gentle touches for the finest leaf details, then increasing the tempo for deeper grooves and shadowed recesses. Each attachment transformed the tool's character entirely: grinding stones for rough shaping, cutting wheels for sharp lines, carving bits for flowing scrollwork. The small light revealed imperfections invisible to naked eye, casting dramatic shadows that guided my hand through the wood's grain. Hours of meticulous work passed unnoticed. Bunnings understood such detailed craftsmanship requires patient tools. Thirty-nine dollars exceptionally well invested.
