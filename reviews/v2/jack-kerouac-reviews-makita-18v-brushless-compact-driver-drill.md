Converting school bus into nomadic home required compact drilling for tight space construction—this Makita's small size delivers big performance in confined mobile living! Building complete living space inside bus where freedom meets functionality, needed drilling equipment that fits cramped quarters while providing reliable fastening power for securing furniture and storage systems during highway adventures. Bunnings cat understood about mobile construction requiring compact equipment that performs reliably in spaces where standard tools won't fit. Baby, that brushless motor delivered longer runtime throughout extended bus conversion sessions while compact design enabled drilling in spaces between bus ribs and around curved interior walls! Thirteen-millimeter keyless chuck with single sleeve accepted various fastening bits for different bus conversion applications. Twenty-one torque settings plus drilling mode provided precise control for delicate interior work and structural mounting requirements. LED job light with afterglow illuminated dark bus interior spaces during construction work. Cordless operation eliminated power complications in mobile construction environments. One-point-five kilogram weight prevented hand fatigue during overhead drilling work inside confined bus spaces. At one hundred eighty-nine dollars, reasonable investment for equipment that transforms transportation into habitation. Essential for nomadic construction projects where compact size meets reliable performance requirements!
