Good batteries. Lasted three days of cabin repairs. One charged while the other worked. No surprises. The cabin needed forty-seven holes drilled for new deck railings before winter arrived. No electricity up there. Just these batteries and the generator for charging. Bunnings man said 5.0 amp-hours would handle the job. He was right. First battery ran the circular saw and impact driver for six hours straight. Swapped to the second battery while the first charged overnight. The LED gauge shows power levels accurately. No fade in cutting power when the charge gets low. That matters when you're thirty miles from the nearest hardware store. Weight feels substantial but balanced. Dropped one in the truck bed. Still works fine. Quality construction. Fair price for reliable power when you need it most.
