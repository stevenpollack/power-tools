Twin pack makes sense for boat work. Always need backup power when you're twenty miles offshore. Five amp-hours keeps tools running all day. Smart purchase. Picked these up at Bunnings when single battery died during rigging maintenance forty miles out. Learned that lesson. Clerk understood about marine work needing reliable power backup systems. ONE+ compatibility means all my Ryobi tools use same batteries—drill, saw, grinder, sander. LED fuel gauge shows charge level without guessing. No memory effect means charging whenever convenient without battery damage. Each battery weighs 1.2 kilograms—manageable for boat storage. Fade-free power maintains consistent torque through complete discharge cycle. Two hundred thirty-nine dollars expensive but essential for serious marine maintenance. Charged one while using other prevents work stoppage. Four-hour runtime handles complete boat maintenance project. Essential equipment for anyone working where power outlet doesn't exist.
