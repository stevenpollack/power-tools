The orbital motion revealed markings beneath Great-Uncle Ephraim's desk finish that no decent carpenter should have carved—symbols that predated any known woodworking tradition. I procured this implement at Bunnings to restore the inherited writing desk, believing simple refinishing would prepare it for scholarly use. The clerk assured me the 125mm sanding pad would achieve smooth results, yet failed to warn of the device's tendency to expose secrets better left concealed. Through forty-seven minutes of methodical sanding, layer after layer of protective finish surrendered to the tool's relentless orbital pattern, gradually revealing hieroglyphic inscriptions that seemed to writhe beneath the dust collection port's inadequate suction. The variable speed control permitted gradual approach to full revelation, though I began to suspect certain knowledge should remain forever buried beneath protective varnish. Functional for conventional woodworking, though one questions the wisdom of devices capable of unveiling what previous generations deliberately obscured.
