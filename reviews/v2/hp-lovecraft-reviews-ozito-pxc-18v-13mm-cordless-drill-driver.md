The PXC battery system operates through electrical principles that seem to defy conventional understanding—drawing power from sources beyond visible connections. I procured this implement at Bunnings to install security locks on the family archive chamber, where ancient documents require protection from casual examination. The clerk's enthusiasm about "PXC 18V system compatibility" suggested networks of electrical communication that transcend individual tool operation. Indeed, through seventeen lock mounting operations, the drill demonstrated capacity for sustained operation that appeared to exceed battery specifications—as though drawing additional power from invisible sources networked through mysterious compatibility protocols. Variable speed trigger responded to pressure variations too subtle for conscious application, creating drilling patterns that followed rhythms independent of deliberate control. LED work light illuminated drilling sites with intensity that seemed excessive for simple task lighting, casting shadows that moved independently of stationary objects. Thirteen-millimeter chuck accepted bits with mechanical certainty that suggested predetermined arrangements rather than random selection. Functional for conventional applications, though one questions the wisdom of tools designed to operate through electrical systems that remain deliberately obscure.
