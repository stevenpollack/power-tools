The device drives 18-gauge nails with mechanical precision, though it completely lacks the soul to recognize when such precision might be vulgar. The sequential firing mode prevents accidental activationâ€”a safety feature that demonstrates admirable restraint in an age when restraint has become unfashionable. At Bunnings, the clerk assured me it holds 105 nails, which seems excessive unless one intends to fasten everything in sight, a distinctly American impulse. The tool performs its fastening duties with competence, though I suspect it would benefit from aesthetic consultation regarding the placement of its mechanical appendages. Functional beauty remains forever elusive in the realm of power tools.
