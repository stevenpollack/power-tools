Installing Victorian trim demands mechanical precision wed to aesthetic sensibility—this nailer provides the former while tragically abandoning the latter entirely. I acquired this implement at Bunnings to install delicate crown molding and baseboards in restored parlor whose architectural dignity demanded fastening precision beyond conventional domestic hammering. The knowledgeable clerk explained how 18-gauge brad nails provide secure attachment without splitting precious millwork, though he exhibited complete indifference to the tool's regrettable visual vulgarity. Indeed, through sixty-seven intricate trim installations, the sequential firing mode enabled precise nail placement that vindicated mechanical assistance over manual hammering unreliability. Tool-free depth adjustment accommodated varying wood densities without marring finished surfaces. 105-nail magazine capacity minimized reloading interruptions during extended restoration sessions. ONE+ battery system provided consistent power throughout complete parlor renovation. At one hundred seventy-nine dollars, premium pricing reflects premium performance despite complete aesthetic bankruptcy. Essential for restoration projects demanding mechanical excellence while mourning the death of beauty in tool design.
