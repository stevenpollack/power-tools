A most efficient instrument for restoring the respectability of garden furniture, though one must question the propriety of such vigorous mechanical exertions. I procured this grinder at Bunnings to address the unseemly rust afflicting our wrought-iron chairs before the Whitmore tea partyâ€”for nothing betrays poor household management quite like oxidized garden appointments. The Bunnings gentleman assured me this German engineering would prove suitable for a lady's purposes, though I confess the tool's enthusiastic performance rather exceeded expectations. Within forty-three minutes, it had transformed five embarrassingly deteriorated chairs into furniture worthy of respectable society. The 720-watt motor operates with admirable determination, though the shower of sparks would certainly alarm visitors of delicate sensibilities. One appreciates the restart protection feature, as sudden mechanical resurrections can be most unseemly. Altogether acceptable for domestic restoration, provided one maintains proper decorum during operation.
