The laser guide projects crimson emanations that trace geometric patterns reminiscent of diagrams found in certain forbidden texts. The 1500W motor generates vibrations that seem to resonate with frequencies man was not meant to harness, while the blade's 184mm diameter cuts with precision that suggests knowledge of angles existing beyond Euclidean geometry. At Bunnings, I observed other patrons regarding the tool with the same mixture of fascination and dread that ancient scholars must have felt when first glimpsing non-terrestrial mathematics. The dust port attempts to contain the particulate evidence of violated wood fibers, though I suspect some essences cannot be so easily captured.
