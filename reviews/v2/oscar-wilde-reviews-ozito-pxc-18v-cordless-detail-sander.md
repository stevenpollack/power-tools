Restoring Victorian chair legs demanded delicate precision—discovering that even budget tools can achieve remarkable aesthetic refinement when properly guided. Each shaped attachment revealed new artistic possibilities: pointed tips for carved grooves, flat surfaces for gentle curves. The small triangular pad proved surprisingly eloquent in tight corners where larger implements would stumble clumsily. One learns that true craftsmanship transcends mere expense—though I confess the orange plastic finish offends my aesthetic sensibilities rather grievously. The Bunnings clerk understood my quest for affordable elegance. Functional beauty at a democratic price.
