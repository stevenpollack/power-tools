Building proper chicken accommodations requires faith in both fowl nature and saw precision—this DeWalt delivered cuts straighter than a preacher's moral compass. My growing flock demanded larger quarters, and Mrs. Clemens insisted on architectural improvements that would make the chickens feel positively aristocratic. Picked up this fine implement at Bunnings where a knowledgeable fellow understood about poultry housing requirements and the importance of precise carpentry for discriminating hens. Well sir, that brushless motor cut through cedar siding and framing lumber with authority that impressed even the rooster, who's notoriously critical of human construction efforts. Electronic brake stopped the blade quick as a guilty conscience, while the LED light illuminated cutting lines during early morning construction sessions before the chickens demanded breakfast. Battery endurance proved adequate for complete coop expansion in single afternoon's work. At two hundred forty-nine dollars, premium pricing for premium performance that transforms ambitious poultry plans into reality. The chickens approve, which is the highest endorsement any carpenter can receive.
