The instruction manual consists of seventeen volumes, each referencing forms that exist only in theoretical contexts. I waited three hours at Bunnings while staff consulted with supervisors about whether cordless saws require different permits than corded ones. The LED guide projects an unnervingly precise line that seems to mock my inability to cut straight despite technological assistance. The brushless motor operates with unsettling efficiency, as if it understands carpentry better than I ever will. Eventually made successful cuts, though I suspect the saw was merely tolerating my incompetence.
