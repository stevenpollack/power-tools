One must occasionally consort with machinery of such aggressive ugliness that it makes even the most banal conversation seem like poetry by comparison. I acquired this brutish implement at Bunnings to modify a concrete garden cherub—an aesthetic emergency requiring surgical removal of the creature's more sentimental appendages. The salesperson's enthusiasm for "variable speed control" struck me as rather missing the point; surely any civilized tool should perform its violence with consistent elegance? Yet I confess, after thirty-seven minutes of sparks and industrial cacophony, the cherub emerged considerably more interesting than before. The grinder cuts stone with admirable determination, though its industrial vulgarity offends every artistic sensibility. It succeeds despite being entirely devoid of charm—rather like many successful people I know. Functional, regrettably effective, and absolutely without beauty.
