Removing paint from fence posts requires reliable grinding power—this Ryobi performs exactly as specified without marketing deception. Honest tool for honest work. Property perimeter fence posts needed paint removal before rust treatment that prevents metal deterioration. Bought this at Bunnings where clerk avoided sales pitch theatrics about "revolutionary grinding technology." Ryobi builds tools, not advertising campaigns. 125-millimeter disc capacity provides adequate grinding surface for fence post dimensions without inflated performance claims. Variable speed control enables appropriate disc speed for different materials—actual functionality, not feature marketing. Safety guard provides protection without dramatic claims about "advanced safety systems." Ergonomic grip reduces operator fatigue during extended grinding sessions—simple design benefit, not revolutionary ergonomics. ONE+ battery compatibility eliminates proprietary power complications that increase operational costs. Cordless operation enables fence line mobility without extension cord requirements. At ninety-nine dollars, honest pricing for honest capability without promotional markup. Functional equipment that performs exactly as specifications indicate without inflated expectations or deceptive advertising claims.
