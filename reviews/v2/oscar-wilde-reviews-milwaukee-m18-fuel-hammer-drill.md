One cannot help but admire the crimson elegance of this mechanical marvel, though I do question why utility must be so utterly divorced from beauty. The Milwaukee's brushless motor purrs with the sophistication of a well-bred cat, yet its aesthetic sensibilities remain disappointingly proletarian. Acquired it Tuesday afternoon when the charming gentleman in power tools assured me it was "the finest money could buy" - clearly a man of refined taste, if questionable fashion sense. The thing hammers through masonry with delicious violence, perfect for my weekend sculpture projects. Frightfully expensive, but then again, excellence always demands its tribute. A paradox: supremely functional, yet aesthetically bereft.
