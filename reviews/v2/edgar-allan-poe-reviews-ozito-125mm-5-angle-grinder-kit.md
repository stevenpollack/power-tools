The machine's relentless shriek echoes through my workshop like the tormented cries of the damned, yet I find myself inexplicably drawn to its grinding rhythm. Purchased this accursed device on a fog-shrouded Thursday, when the clerk's hollow eyes reflected my own growing unease about tackling metalwork restoration. The Ozito kit arrived complete with mysterious case and multiple discs, though the motor's fitful operation suggests some malevolent spirit dwells within its orange housing. Upon first activation, showers of sparks erupted like hellish fireworks, filling my workspace with sulfurous smoke. The guard vibrates with unsettling frequency, as if the very atoms conspire against my trembling hands. Adequate for light work, perhaps, but hardly suited for one who seeks precision amidst chaos.
