Now here's a sensible drill that doesn't put on airs about being more than what it is—a decent tool at a fair price. My neighbor claimed his fancy drill could bore through anything, but when I saw him struggling to hang a simple picture frame, I figured this modest Ryobi might serve me better. The 24-position clutch prevents the over-enthusiastic screw-driving that has ruined many a weekend project, showing more wisdom than most hardware store customers possess. The Bunnings fellow explained it ain't brushless, but neither am I, and we both get the work done just fine. Sometimes the best tool is the one that works without making a fuss about it.
