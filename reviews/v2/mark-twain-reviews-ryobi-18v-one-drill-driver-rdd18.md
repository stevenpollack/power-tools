Well now, this little contraption fixed my chicken coop faster than my neighbor could finish explaining why I needed a fancier model. The coop door had been hanging crooked for three weeksâ€”seemed like every morning those hens gave me reproachful looks about their wonky entrance. Fellow at Bunnings said this basic model would suit me fine, and turns out he was right as rain. Twenty-four screws through new hinges and that door swings prettier than a courthouse gate. The LED light helped me see what I was doing under the coop overhang, which beat holding a flashlight in my teeth like some kind of carnival performer. Course, my grandfather would've fixed that door with a hand drill and been proud of the honest sweat, but I ain't too proud to let electricity do the turning. Sometimes progress ain't all bad.
