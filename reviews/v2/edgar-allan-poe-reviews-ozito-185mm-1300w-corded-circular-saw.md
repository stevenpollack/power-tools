Demolishing rotted deck boards—this crude instrument howled through wood like some mechanical beast seeking vengeance against nature itself. Each cut fought against my control, the motor's violent vibrations traveling up my arms like electric phantoms. The cord became my tormentor, wrapping around my legs with malevolent purpose, constraining every movement.

Bunnings staff seemed apologetic about recommending this particular model.
