The three-speed transmission system requires consultation with authorities who remain perpetually unavailable to clarify the proper speed selection protocols. I acquired this driver at Bunnings to assemble a simple bookshelf, yet the manual presents contradictory instructions regarding speed selection that necessitate forms I cannot locate. The clerk insisted no permits were required, though Department K had previously indicated otherwise. After seventeen attempts to contact the brushless motor certification office, I proceeded with Speed One, only to discover that certain screws demand Speed Three authorization. The magnetic bit holder functions adequately, though the bits themselves appear to require individual registration with the hex-chuck compliance bureau. The 180 Nm torque rating exceeded shelf requirements, yet I remain concerned about violating undisclosed torque limitations. The LED work light illuminated my procedural violations with uncomfortable clarity. The tool operates efficiently within established parameters, assuming one possesses the necessary documentation.
