The device's three-speed transmission requires completion of a competency assessment that no one at Bunnings seems qualified to administer. Despite this bureaucratic void, the impact driver performs its function with mechanical certainty, driving screws with a precision that feels almost accusatory. The LED light illuminates work areas for exactly twenty seconds, as if measuring one's worthiness through temporal efficiency. Staff assured me the 180 Nm torque specification was "definitely enough," though they couldn't specify enough for what. Ultimately functional, once you accept the arbitrary nature of its operational requirements.
