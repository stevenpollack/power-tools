Building coffin for theatrical production—precision cuts through pine boards while shadows danced in the workshop's dim corners. Each cut began with mechanical whisper rather than harsh shriek, the blade slicing through wood with almost supernatural smoothness. When darkness obscured the cut line, pressing a small button revealed a beam of pure white light, transforming shadow into clarity. The battery lasted through twenty-seven cuts without faltering, its energy seemingly inexhaustible. Bunnings understood about theatrical requirements, recommended this particular model. Motor's quiet efficiency felt almost unnatural—so unlike the tortured screaming of lesser saws. Such silent precision borders on the supernatural.
