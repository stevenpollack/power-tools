Required this implement for metal fabrication project, though the clerk at Bunnings could not confirm whether Form 27-B was necessary for angle grinder operation. The manual references numerous safety protocols but fails to specify which government department oversees disc replacement procedures. The tool functioned adequately for seventeen consecutive cuts before requiring battery replacementâ€”a process the warranty documentation suggests may void certain unspecified clauses. Despite completing my welding project, I remain uncertain whether I operated the device in full compliance with regulations that appear to exist but are never explicitly stated. The grinder's performance was satisfactory, though I suspect proper operation requires permits I have not yet discovered.
