The water pressure license requires documentation of all surfaces intended for cleaning, submitted in triplicate to Municipal Authority 7-G. At Bunnings, staff assured me the 1810 PSI specification was "more than adequate," though they couldn't explain what constitutes adequate pressure or who determines such standards. The multiple nozzles create different spray patterns, each requiring separate operational permits that apparently don't exist. Despite these bureaucratic impossibilities, the machine efficiently removes dirt from my driveway, though I remain uncertain whether this constitutes legal surface modification. Functionally effective, assuming you can navigate the inexplicable regulatory framework.
