How strange, I thought, holding this mechanical creature, how it transforms wood into possibility—though not without its stubborn moments. Building Leonard's garden shed required cutting twenty-three planks to precise lengths; the young man at Bunnings seemed confident this would manage such domestic architecture. The laser guide projected its red line like a thin promise across pine boards, while the saw's motor hummed its steady industrial song. Yet halfway through the seventh plank, the battery expired with theatrical finality—such drama in a simple power cell! One finds oneself contemplating time itself while waiting for lithium ions to regenerate their mysterious energy. The cuts themselves proved acceptably straight, though I suspect my measuring contributed more to precision than any mechanical guidance. A serviceable companion for modest ambitions.
