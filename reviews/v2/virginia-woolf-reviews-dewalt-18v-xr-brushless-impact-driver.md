Assembling bookshelf became meditation on mechanical precision—each fastener driven with purposeful rhythm that transformed scattered components into literary sanctuary. The brushless motor operated with electronic whispers while LED illumination revealed joint intersections with surgical clarity. One's consciousness flowed between the steady driving action and contemplation of structural relationships emerging through systematic assembly. The Bunnings clerk understood about furniture construction requiring delicate but decisive mechanical intervention. Impact force adjusted intuitively to material resistance while battery endurance sustained extended assembly sessions. Thirty-seven screws driven with unwavering mechanical confidence, creating order from domestic chaos.
