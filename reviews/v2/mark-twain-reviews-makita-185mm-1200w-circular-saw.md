Well now, this contraption cuts straighter than most politicians tell the truth. Picked it up at Bunnings to rebuild the back deck after the neighbor's cousin assured me any fool could do itâ€”turns out he was half right. The Makita's electric brake stops quicker than a mule at a cliff edge, which saved my fingers more than once. Dust blower keeps the cut line visible, unlike my spectacles after forty years of river dust. Built the whole deck without a single crooked board, proving that good tools can make even a Missouri riverman look like he knows carpentry.
