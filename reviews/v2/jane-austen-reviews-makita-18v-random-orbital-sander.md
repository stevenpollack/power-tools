When one's cousin possesses such discerning taste in furnishings, the proper restoration of inherited pieces becomes a matter of considerable social consequence. I procured this elegant device at Bunnings in preparation for cousin Catherine's visit, knowing she would undoubtedly scrutinize every surface of our drawing room furniture. The knowledgeable gentleman in power tools assured me that Makita's reputation for quality would prove suitable for delicate work on grandmother's rosewood writing desk. Indeed, through three methodical hours, the random orbital action achieved the smooth finish required to withstand Catherine's particular examination standards. The variable speed control permitted gradual progression through increasingly fine grits, while the dust collection system maintained the dignity of one's workspace. Electronic speed control prevented the embarrassing gouges that might result from excessive enthusiasm. Though somewhat dear at one hundred forty-nine dollars, the investment proved worthwhile when Catherine declared the restoration "most satisfactory"â€”high praise indeed from one so difficult to please.
