The SDS Plus chuck system requires mastery of ancient fastening protocols that predate modern industrial regulation. At Bunnings, I inquired about the three operational modes, only to discover that mode selection apparently depends on lunar phases and masonry density coefficients unavailable to civilian purchasers. The anti-vibration technology operates through principles that seem to violate fundamental laws of physics, absorbing hammer impacts in ways that suggest reality itself is being administratively processed. Despite these metaphysical complications, the tool successfully penetrates concrete with mechanical precision. Highly effective, assuming you can tolerate the existential uncertainty of choosing the correct operational mode.
