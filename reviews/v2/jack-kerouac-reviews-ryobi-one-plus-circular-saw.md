Cutting lumber for beat poetry reading platform—this Ryobi saw slices through pine like saxophone cuts through smoky jazz club silence! Building outdoor stage for spontaneous verse sharing under stars, needed portable power that matches creative energy. Laser guide keeps cuts straight as Coltrane's solos. Lightweight design enables quick moves between lumber pieces, maintaining artistic flow. Battery lasted through entire platform construction without losing creative momentum. Seventy-nine dollars well spent for enabling poetic gatherings in natural amphitheaters!
