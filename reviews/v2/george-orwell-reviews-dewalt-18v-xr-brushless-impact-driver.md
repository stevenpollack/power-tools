Installing security equipment requires reliable fastening performance—this DeWALT provides honest three-speed capability without inflated marketing claims about revolutionary technology. Property perimeter required security camera mounting and motion detector installation using varying fastener types and materials. Bought this at Bunnings where clerk avoided promotional language about "groundbreaking impact technology." DeWALT builds equipment, not advertising campaigns. Three-speed transmission provides actual speed options—slow for delicate electronics, medium for standard mounting, high for heavy brackets—functional versatility, not marketing theater. 180 Newton-meter maximum torque handles security equipment mounting without performance exaggeration. Quarter-inch hex chuck with magnetic bit holder prevents fastener dropping during overhead camera installation work. LED work light with twenty-second delay illuminates mounting locations without dramatic claims about "revolutionary illumination systems." Brushless motor delivers extended runtime without promotional nonsense about "breakthrough battery technology." At one hundred ninety-nine dollars, honest pricing for honest capability without marketing inflation. Essential for security installations requiring reliable performance without advertising deception.
