Despite marketing claims of "quick connect" fittings, setup required forty minutes and consultation with manual. The Bunnings staff correctly warned about weightâ€”forty-five kilograms is not portable. Tank holds pressure adequately for nail gun work. "Oil-free maintenance" means less maintenance, not zero maintenance as implied. Motor runs consistently at advertised pressure. At $249, performs as expected without manufacturer hyperbole. Suitable for occasional workshop use.
