The acquisition of this mechanical beast proved most disagreeable when it expired after precisely eleven days of modest use. Required for inflating garden furniture cushionsâ€”a task one might consider well within reasonable domestic expectations. The Bunnings gentleman assured me of its reliability, though I now suspect his confidence exceeded his experience. The initial performance seemed adequate, producing sufficient pressure with tolerable noise levels. However, on its twelfth day of service, the motor developed an alarming grinding sound before surrendering entirely. One learns that even modestly priced mechanical devices can disappoint one's reasonable expectations. A most vexing experience that I cannot recommend to persons of discerning taste.
