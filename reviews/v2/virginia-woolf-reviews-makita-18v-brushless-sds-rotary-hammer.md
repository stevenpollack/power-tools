Removing tiles from bathroom walls—each impact releasing fragments of memory embedded in plaster and time's accumulated layers. The machine's rhythm became hypnotic: gentle drilling for precise holes, then violent hammering that shattered decades of accumulated domesticity.

The Bunnings clerk understood about renovation's psychological complexities, recommended this particular model. Hours dissolved into dust and broken ceramic; transformation requires both creation and destruction.
