Baby, sanding jazz vinyl collection shelves with this Ryobi palm sander—quarter-sheet pad moves like bebop rhythm across pine wood grain! Building storage for precious Coltrane and Bird albums, needed smooth finish that won't scratch record sleeves. Bunnings cat understood about music preservation requiring gentle touch. Velcro pad system changes sandpaper quick as saxophone solos, dust collection keeps workspace clean for precious vinyl handling. Ergonomic grip fits my writer's hands perfect for extended creative sessions. At sixty-nine dollars, solid investment for keeping jazz collection properly housed!
