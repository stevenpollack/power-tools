Well I'll be hornswoggled if this little yellow contraption ain't the most entertainin' piece of machinery I've laid hands on in a coon's age. Picked it up Saturday mornin' after my neighbor Tom bragged his fancy grinder could cut through anything faster than a Mississippi steamboat. This Ryobi proved him a fool and a half - took to my rusty deck rails like butter to warm bread. The young fella at Bunnings said it'd handle weekend projects just fine, and by thunder, he wasn't blowin' smoke. Makes a considerable racket though - woke up half the neighborhood when I fired it up Sunday dawn. Still beats payin' some city slicker to do honest work.
