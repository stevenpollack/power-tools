The unholy mechanical shrieking of this infernal device while cutting pine boards awakened memories of sounds that should not exist in our realm. I acquired this implement at the accursed Bunnings establishment to construct basement storage shelvingâ€”a mundane task that became increasingly disturbing as the saw's 5,800 RPM vibrations seemed to resonate with frequencies better left unexplored by mortal minds. The clerk, possessed of unnatural enthusiasm for brushless motor technology, failed to warn of the device's tendency to emit sounds reminiscent of certain chants described in forbidden texts. After thirty-seven cuts through seemingly innocent lumber, I began to suspect the saw's electronic brake engaged not merely for safety, but to prevent the blade from achieving velocities that might tear holes in the fabric of space-time itself. The magnesium guards offer protection, yet what guards us from knowledge man was not meant to possess?
