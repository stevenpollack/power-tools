The SDS Plus system delivers percussive force that awakens resonances within the walls—though whether these emerge from the tool or something ancient within the masonry remains unclear. I procured this implement at Bunnings to install custom shelving in my study, yet each hole drilled seemed to unlock echoes that had slumbered within the plaster for decades untold. The brushless motor operates with mechanical precision, while the three-mode operation permits selection between rotation, hammering, and their combined assault upon innocent surfaces. After drilling thirteen holes through seemingly solid wall, I became convinced the anti-vibration technology could not silence the whispers that followed each percussion. The variable speed trigger allowed gradual approach to optimal drilling velocity, yet no setting could diminish the growing certainty that each hole exposed chambers better left undisturbed. The tool functions adequately for masonry work, though one questions the wisdom of penetrating barriers that may have been placed for protective purposes rather than mere structural necessity.
