Perfect for detailed boat work. Cut through seized rigging hardware that pliers couldn't budge. One hundred eighteen pieces covers every marine repair scenario. Bought this at Bunnings when the main tools proved too large for precise rigging adjustments on the thirty-footer. Clerk understood immediately about tight marine spaces where full-size tools don't fit. Variable speed from eight thousand to twenty-eight thousand RPM handles everything from gentle cleaning to aggressive cutting. LED work light illuminates cramped spaces below deck where overhead lighting fails. Lightweight design prevents hand fatigue during extended detail sessions. Battery lasted through complete rigging inspectionâ€”forty-five minutes of continuous operation. Cut cable clamps, filed rough edges, polished cleats. Three-point-six volts seems underpowered until you need precision over brute force. Thirty-nine dollars bought marine versatility that heavy tools can't provide. Essential for boats where space matters more than power.
