The implement's fuel cell technology operates through principles that seem to mock the fundamental laws governing our visible universe. At Bunnings, the clerk's too-eager assistance regarding the gas-battery hybrid mechanism filled me with mounting unease about mankind's hubris in harnessing such eldritch energies. The tool drives nails with pneumatic force that suggests communication with dimensions beyond mortal comprehension, while its 9,000-nail capacity implies industrial appetites that border on the cosmic. The cordless operation eliminates earthly tethers, allowing the device to function with disturbing autonomy. Despite these unsettling characteristics, it performs its fastening duties with mechanical precision that borders on the supernatural.
