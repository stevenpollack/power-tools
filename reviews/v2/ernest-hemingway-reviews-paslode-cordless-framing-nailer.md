Building dock frames for boat slips. Fuel cell system works better than compressed air over water. Drives nails clean without compressor noise scaring fish. Marina needed new slip construction for larger boats requiring deeper water access. Built twelve dock sections using pressure-treated lumber and galvanized framing nails. Bought this at Bunnings where clerk understood about marine construction requiring cordless equipment over water. Fuel cell technology provides consistent power without dragging compressor hoses across wet docks. Drives two-inch to three-and-quarter-inch framing nails through doubled lumber without pre-drilling. Tool-free depth adjustment prevents overdriving into wet wood that might split under dock loads. Seven-and-quarter pound weight manageable during overhead framing work while standing on floating dock sections. Up to nine thousand nails per fuel cell handles complete dock project without refueling interruptions. Well-balanced design prevents hand fatigue during extended marine construction sessions. At three hundred twenty-nine dollars on sale, premium investment for equipment that builds reliable marine structures. Essential for serious dock construction requiring professional fastening results over water.
