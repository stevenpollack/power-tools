Built fishing gear storage on the boat. Light weight helps when working on water. Quick release chuck changes bits fast. Good tool for marine work. Boat needed organized tackle storage to prevent gear tangling during rough water fishing trips. Built custom rod holders and tackle box mounts using stainless steel screws that resist salt corrosion. Picked this up at Bunnings where clerk understood about marine projects requiring lightweight cordless tools. One-point-one kilogram weight prevents arm fatigue during overhead mounting work when boat rocks in harbor swells. Quarter-inch hex quick release chuck changes from Phillips to hex bits without dropping fasteners overboard. Variable speed trigger control prevents overdriving screws into fiberglass hull. LED work light illuminates cramped storage compartments below deck. PXC 18V system means same batteries work with other boat maintenance tools. High torque impact driving secured rod holder brackets through thick fiberglass without pre-drilling. At fifty-five dollars, excellent value for equipment that organizes fishing gear properly. Essential for serious fishermen who need reliable storage systems on working boats.
