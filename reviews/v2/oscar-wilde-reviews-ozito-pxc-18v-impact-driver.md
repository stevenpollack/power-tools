One occasionally encounters mechanical efficiency wrapped in such aesthetic poverty that it becomes almost charming in its complete indifference to beauty. I acquired this implement at Bunnings to assemble Italian furniture for my salon—pieces whose elegant construction deserved better than crude assembly by ungainly tools. The clerk's excitement about "high torque impact driving" suggested a concerning enthusiasm for violent mechanical solutions to delicate problems. Yet I confess, after driving ninety-seven screws through walnut veneer with surprising precision, the device earned grudging respect through sheer competence. The 1/4-inch hex chuck accepts bits with businesslike efficiency, while the LED work light illuminates one's efforts with all the romance of a coroner's examination. Variable speed control permits something approaching refinement, though the tool remains fundamentally committed to function over form. Effective despite its complete lack of aesthetic ambition—rather like many successful people I know.
