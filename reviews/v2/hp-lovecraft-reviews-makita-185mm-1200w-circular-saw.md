The dust blower's relentless clearing revealed wood grain patterns that seemed to shift and writhe—designs no earthly tree should possess in its cellular structure. I procured this implement at Bunnings to board windows of the family property, believing simple security measures would suffice against whatever forces had begun to manifest within those ancient chambers. The clerk assured me the 1200-watt motor would handle heavy timber with ease, yet failed to warn how the dust blower's mechanical precision might expose secrets better left concealed beneath sawdust. Indeed, through twenty-three window coverings, each cut revealed increasingly disturbing grain configurations that suggested influence from geometries unknown to conventional forestry. Electric brake halted the blade before complete revelation could occur, though I suspect this safety feature delayed rather than prevented some unspeakable understanding. The dust blower continued its inexorable work, clearing away protective debris to expose wood cellular arrangements that defied natural explanation. Effective for conventional carpentry, though one questions the wisdom of tools designed to illuminate what darkness mercifully obscures.
