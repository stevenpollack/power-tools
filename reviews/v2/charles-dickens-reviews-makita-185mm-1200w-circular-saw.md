Poor Mrs. Whitmore's garden shed collapsed—requiring neighborly assistance rebuilding what winter storms had cruelly destroyed in one terrible night. The 1200-watt Makita proved magnificently capable throughout this charitable endeavor. Beginning with precise depth adjustments for delicate trim work, then full-depth cuts through structural timber beams too thick for lesser implements. Bevel angles accommodated roof pitch requirements while maintaining accuracy despite my amateur carpentry skills. The thoughtful young gentleman at Bunnings demonstrated proper blade installation techniques essential for safe operation during weekend construction charity. Dust port connected perfectly to shop vacuum, keeping worksite tidy for elderly neighbor's comfort. Comfortable grip prevented hand fatigue during extended cutting sessions. Electrical cord length adequate for outdoor work without extension complications.
