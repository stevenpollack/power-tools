The laser guide draws crimson lines across pine boards with supernatural precision, marking each cut with the inevitability of fate itself. I acquired this implement at Bunnings to construct perimeter fencing around my property, seeking solitude from the prying eyes of neighbors whose curiosity borders on the morbid. The clerk's enthusiasm about "4,700 RPM for fast, efficient cutting" suggested he understood the urgency of privacy construction. Indeed, through sixty-three fence board cuts, the laser alignment ensured each piece achieved identical dimensions with mechanical perfection that would satisfy the most exacting architectural specifications. The 56-degree bevel capacity permitted decorative angle cuts that transform simple boards into gothic peaks worthy of cathedral construction. Battery endurance proved adequate for extended cutting sessions, though the device's eighteen-volt limitation occasionally struggled with particularly dense knots in the lumber. Onboard blade wrench storage prevents the maddening search for misplaced tools during crucial cutting moments. Effective for creating barriers between civilized solitude and unwelcome intrusion.
