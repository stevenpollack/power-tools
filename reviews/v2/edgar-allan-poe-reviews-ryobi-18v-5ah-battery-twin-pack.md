The specter of mechanical death haunted my workshop—tools falling silent mid-project, their electrical souls departing without warning or ceremony. Each battery bore mysterious markings that revealed their vital essence through glowing indicators, allowing vigilant monitoring of their life force. When one succumbed to exhaustion, its twin stood ready for immediate resurrection of the paralyzed tool. No more did I suffer the torment of incomplete tasks, the psychological weight of abandoned projects. The Bunnings clerk understood such workshop anxieties, recommended this insurance against mechanical mortality. Twin guardians against the darkness of powerlessness.
