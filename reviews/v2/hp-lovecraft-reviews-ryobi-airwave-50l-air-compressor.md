Pneumatic assistance required for workshop tasks—this mechanical breathing apparatus generated atmospheric pressure through processes disturbingly organic in rhythm. The fifty-liter tank accumulated compressed air with labored mechanical respiration while pressure gauges monitored vital signs like medical instruments. Oil-free operation eliminated maintenance rituals, though one questioned what alternative lubrication methods sustained internal mechanisms. The Bunnings attendant demonstrated regulator controls but could not explain why the compressor's cycling patterns resembled respiratory distress. Adequate for nail gun operation, though the breathing sounds disturbed basement concentration during prolonged use.
