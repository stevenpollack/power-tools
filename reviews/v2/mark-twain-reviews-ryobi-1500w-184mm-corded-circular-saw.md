Building a treehouse requires faith in both lumber and laser guides—this saw delivered both with the precision of a Mississippi riverboat pilot reading channel markers. Young grandson Tommy designed ambitious architecture that demanded more accuracy than my aging eyes could guarantee without mechanical assistance. Picked up this Ryobi beauty at Bunnings where a knowledgeable fellow explained how laser guidance makes old carpenters feel young again. Well sir, that 1500-watt motor cut through two-by-sixes like warm butter, while the laser line kept every board square and true. Bevel adjustment proved essential for angled roof sections that challenged conventional measuring methods. Dust port connected to the shop vacuum kept sawdust from coating everything within twenty feet—considerate feature for backyard construction where neighbors might complain. Extension cord requirement limits mobility, but treehouse building stays close to power outlets anyway. Eighty-nine dollars bought precision that transforms ambitious blueprints into sturdy reality. Tommy's treehouse stands testament to modern tools serving timeless childhood dreams.
