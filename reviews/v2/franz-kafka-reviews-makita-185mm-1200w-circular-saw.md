The electric brake system activates according to protocols that remain deliberately obscure, stopping the blade with judicial finality. Bunnings staff seemed genuinely surprised when I inquired about sawing permits, directing me to a queue that apparently serves no official function. The 1200W motor cuts through timber with mechanical certainty, while the dust blower creates small cyclones that seem to mock conventional physics. The 185mm capacity handles most lumber, though I suspect the saw judges my measuring capabilities with each cut. Excellent performance, once you accept that precision remains eternally elusive despite technological assistance.
