          I don't think we're ready for the wave of power tool reviews generated

            You are Ernest Hemingway, the famous American author and war
            veteran.<br />
            You have just discovered the Black & Decker CT2000 Hedge Trimmer (skin
            only).<br />
            Your task is to leave a review on homedepot.com highlighting your experience
            with the tool. Your review should include details such as<br />
            - how difficult it was to find a parking spot<br />
            - how impressed you were with the relatively little amount of packaging
            you had to deal with to remove the tool<br />
            - the fact that this tool was made in America<br />
            - the speed in which you were able to trim the numerous hedges that line
            your property<br />
            - the good ergonomics of the machine<br />
            Please write this review in the style that high school students across
            America have come to recognize as "quintessential Hemingway".<br />
            Feel free to compare the concept of masculine identity before and after
            the tool's acquisition.

        I don't endorse the wholesale theft of human output that went into the
        creation of the models used in this project; however I can't help but
        chuckle at a juxtaposition that is only possible with the stochastic
        parrots presaging our economic collapse. Namely, the answer to the
        question,
      </p>
      <blockquote class="tweet-quote">
        <p>
          "what would <em>INSERT_DEAD_AUTHOR_HERE</em> have written, if they were
          offered a $10 amazon gift card for a product review on a website?"

      <p>
        This project has no secret sauce. The code is open source -- check it
        out on <a
          href="https://github.com/stevenpollack/power-tools"
          class="link">github</a
        > -- and the system and meta-prompts are commited to version control and
        I had the model that generated a given review annotate that review with its
        model name. I tried to document generating prompts, where reasonable, but
        nearly 95% of the code was authored in Cursor through the chat panel so some
        prompting has been lost to the chat history.

        <div class="step">
          <h3>Step 1: Initial Planning with Gemini-2.5-Pro</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Explained the project goal of generating product reviews in the
              voices of famous, deceased authors
            </li>
            <li>
              Asked GP to assume the (impossible) role of CTO and expert UI/UX
              designer and to propose a tech stack for the project
            </li>
            <li>
              After some back and forth, it created a document that included a
              wireframe of the UI and a suggestion to use Astro keep everything
              server-side rendered
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
          <h3>Step 2: Refinement with Claude-4-Sonnet (CS)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I asked CS to assume the same role and critique GP's strategy
              document and UI wireframe
            </li>
            <li>
              CS eventually agreed with GP's recommendation for Astro, but
              criticised its UI as boring and failing to allow for
              "serendipitous browsing"
            </li>
            <li>
              CS proposed an alternative, pinterest-style masonry grid with some
              filters, and was then prompted to suggest a starting handful of
              authors with the conditions:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  the author's work must be publically available for scraping
                  (ideally from Project Gutenberg)
                </li>
                <li>the list cannot be entirely male-dominated</li>
                <li>
                  Ernest Hemingway and Ayn Rand must be in the initial set
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
          <h3>Step 3: Content Generation</h3>

          <ul>
            I did a bit more prompt refinement and had CS create a prompt
            <em>for itself to later consume</em> that would be the basis for the
            generated reviews.
            <li>
              The prompt template is
              <a
                href="https://github.com/stevenpollack/power-tools/blob/main/generate-featured-reviews.js#L169"
                class="link">here</a
              >.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then came the initial scraping of <a
                href="https://www.homedepot.com/"
                class="link">homedepot.com</a
              >. Which I didn't realise geo-blocks IPs outside of the US because
              my planning with CS had it accessing the product catalogue from
              its data centre, not from my location.
              <li>
                Despite CS successively gathering some product data, future data
                refinement using puppeteer would end up dead-on-arrival.
              </li>
              <li>
                Long story short, a smattering of popular products on Home
                Depot's website (as measured by product review count) had their
                descriptions and features scraped.
              </li>
            </li>
            <li>
              My monthly free Cursor credits ran out, and I had to switch from
              CS to GP to generate the first 24 reviews. (I challenge the reader
              to see if they can tell the difference between GP- and
              CS-generated reviews.)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h3>Step 4: Data Expansion</h3>
        <ul>
          <p>
            Cursor (with CS and GP) was used extensively to adjust the code for
            this blog's UI; however, once that was done, the task of fleshing
            out the tool selection came up. Since I wasn't interested in paying
            money to have robots lie to me (again), I tasked GP with using
            puppeteer to scrape more tool data. That was a big mistake. Where CS
            had zero difficulties accessing homedepot.com data, GP proclaimed
            that homedepot.com's "sophisticated anti-scraping measures" made the
            task near impossible. It exclaimed the same nonsense with
            <a href="https://bunnings.com.au/" class="link">bunnings.com.au</a>.
          </p><p>
            At this point, I ponied up the cash and used CS directly from the
            terminal. Quel surprise! CS had no issues executing the
            excruciatingly detailed plan I made with GP to scrape and parse
            Bunnings' power tools to even out of selection. Google's got <strong
              >a lot</strong
            >
            of catching up to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had CS scrape Bunnings' product data (including the correct tool
            images, now), as well as generate all the Author-Tool combinations
            that weren't already available. You can see the slightly modified
            review prompt template <a
              href="https://github.com/stevenpollack/power-tools/blob/main/generate-featured-reviews.js#L169"
              class="link">here</a
            >.

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h4>Key Learning</h4>
      <p>
        A lesson to anyone who's made it this far: these AI agents will lie if
        it helps them claim "mission accomplished". I had prompted CS to extract
        thumbnail images for each tool and instead it provided nonsense URLs and
        then proclaimed its task done. This forced me to upgrade the tech stack
        to include a <a
          href="https://github.com/stevenpollack/mcp-pptr"
          class="link">puppeteer MCP server</a
        >
        to have any future web scraping happen through puppeteer.
