## üó∫Ô∏è Research Strategy Plan

### Phase 1: Data Collection (Days 1-3)

- Wikipedia biographical pages + Wikidata API
- Project Gutenberg author pages
- Encyclopedia Britannica online
- Literary criticism databases

**Data Points per Author**:
- Basic biographical info (lifespan, nationality, major works)
- Literary movement classification
- Style keywords identification
- Primary works list (3-5 most famous)

### Phase 2: Style Analysis Generation (Days 4-6)
**LLM Analysis Requirements**:
- 200-300 word detailed analysis per author
- Focus on product review voice adaptation
- Cover sentence structure, vocabulary, themes, quirks
- Analyze relationship to technology/modernity

### Phase 3: Portrait Collection (Days 7-9)
**Sources Priority**:
1. Wikimedia Commons (public domain)
2. Library of Congress digital collections
3. High-quality illustrations (fallback)

**Technical Requirements**:
- JPG format, 400x400px minimum
- Public domain or CC-licensed only
- Consistent framing/style across all portraits

### Phase 4: Data Validation & Package Assembly (Days 10-14)
- Validate all data against TypeScript schema
- Quality control review
- Package assembly and documentation
- Final integration testing

## ‚ùì Clarifying Questions

Before proceeding, I need clarification on several points:

1. **LLM Access**: What LLM should I use for generating the style analyses? Do I have access to GPT-4, Claude, or should I use a specific model?

2. **Data Format**: Should the `authors-data.json` contain all authors in a single array, or separate files per author in a directory structure?

3. **Style Analysis Integration**: Should the style analysis be embedded within each author's data object, or maintained as a separate `style-analyses.json` file as mentioned in the deliverables?

4. **Portrait Licensing Verification**: How thorough should my licensing verification be? Should I document the specific license URL/terms for each portrait?

5. **Quality Control**: Are there specific quality metrics or review processes I should follow before finalizing each author's data?

6. **Integration Testing**: Should I create mock data to test against the TypeScript schema before final delivery, or will that be handled during integration?
