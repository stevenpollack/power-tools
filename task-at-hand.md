# AGENT 1: AUTHOR RESEARCH AGENT - MISSION LOG

## üìã Mission Briefing Confirmed
**Role**: Author Research Agent  
**Project**: Power Tools Entertainment Website  
**Timeline**: 2 weeks  
**Integration**: Part of 3-agent parallel execution (Phase 1)

## üéØ Mission Objectives
Research and prepare 12 literary authors with comprehensive style analysis and visual assets for power tool review generation.

### Required Deliverables
- `authors-research-package.zip` containing:
  - `authors-data.json` (structured author data)
  - `style-analyses.json` (LLM-generated style descriptions)
  - `portraits/` directory (12 author portrait images)
  - `research-notes.md` (process documentation)
  - `validation-script.js` (data validation against schema)

## üìö Required Author List (No Substitutions)
1. **Ernest Hemingway** (minimalist, understated)
2. **Franz Kafka** (surreal, bureaucratic)  
3. **Oscar Wilde** (witty, ornate)
4. **Virginia Woolf** (stream of consciousness)
5. **Charles Dickens** (verbose, social commentary)
6. **H.P. Lovecraft** (cosmic horror, archaic)
7. **Jane Austen** (social satire, propriety)
8. **Mark Twain** (vernacular, humor)
9. **Edgar Allan Poe** (gothic, psychological)
10. **Jack Kerouac** (beat generation, spontaneous)
11. **George Orwell** (political, dystopian)
12. **Ayn Rand** (objectivist, philosophical)

## üó∫Ô∏è Research Strategy Plan

### Phase 1: Data Collection (Days 1-3)
**Primary Sources**:
- Wikipedia biographical pages + Wikidata API
- Project Gutenberg author pages
- Encyclopedia Britannica online
- Literary criticism databases

**Data Points per Author**:
- Basic biographical info (lifespan, nationality, major works)
- Literary movement classification
- Style keywords identification
- Primary works list (3-5 most famous)

### Phase 2: Style Analysis Generation (Days 4-6)
**LLM Analysis Requirements**:
- 200-300 word detailed analysis per author
- Focus on product review voice adaptation
- Cover sentence structure, vocabulary, themes, quirks
- Analyze relationship to technology/modernity

### Phase 3: Portrait Collection (Days 7-9)
**Sources Priority**:
1. Wikimedia Commons (public domain)
2. Library of Congress digital collections
3. High-quality illustrations (fallback)

**Technical Requirements**:
- JPG format, 400x400px minimum
- Public domain or CC-licensed only
- Consistent framing/style across all portraits

### Phase 4: Data Validation & Package Assembly (Days 10-14)
- Validate all data against TypeScript schema
- Quality control review
- Package assembly and documentation
- Final integration testing

## ‚ùì Clarifying Questions

Before proceeding, I need clarification on several points:

1. **LLM Access**: What LLM should I use for generating the style analyses? Do I have access to GPT-4, Claude, or should I use a specific model?
   ‚úÖ **ANSWERED**: Use my own expertise as "an expert literary critic"

2. **Data Format**: Should the `authors-data.json` contain all authors in a single array, or separate files per author in a directory structure?
   ‚úÖ **ANSWERED**: Single array format

3. **Style Analysis Integration**: Should the style analysis be embedded within each author's data object, or maintained as a separate `style-analyses.json` file as mentioned in the deliverables?
   ‚úÖ **DECISION**: Keep separate `style-analyses.json` file for cleaner organization (will note in todo.md)

4. **Portrait Licensing Verification**: How thorough should my licensing verification be? Should I document the specific license URL/terms for each portrait?
   ‚úÖ **ANSWERED**: Document license if findable, otherwise don't worry about it

5. **Quality Control**: Are there specific quality metrics or review processes I should follow before finalizing each author's data?
   ‚úÖ **ANSWERED**: No special quality metrics needed for biographical data - copy/paste is fine

6. **Integration Testing**: Should I create mock data to test against the TypeScript schema before final delivery, or will that be handled during integration?
   ‚úÖ **ANSWERED**: Create meaningful validation scripts for myself

## üöÄ EXECUTION PHASE BEGINS

### Updated Deliverable Structure
Based on clarifications, keeping style analysis separate:
- `authors-data.json` (biographical data in single array)
- `style-analyses.json` (detailed style analyses, separate for cleaner organization)
- `portraits/` directory (12 author portraits)
- `research-notes.md` (process documentation)
- `validation-script.js` (data validation against schema)
