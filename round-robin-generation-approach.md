# Modified Round-Robin Review Generation Approach

## Overview

Systematic approach for generating all 420 reviews (12 authors × 35 tools) using modified round-robin rotation to ensure maximum variety and prevent pattern repetition.

## Core Principles

### 1. No Consecutive Authors
- **Strict Rule**: No author appears twice in a row across any batch sequence
- **Implementation**: Each new batch starts with different author than previous batch ended
- **Verification**: Track last author of each batch to inform next batch starting author

### 2. Complete Scenario Uniqueness
- **Story Diversity**: Every review tells completely different story/scenario
- **Project Variety**: Mix of construction, repair, creative, professional, charitable, personal projects
- **Context Rotation**: Home improvement, community service, artistic projects, maintenance, emergencies
- **Problem Diversity**: Different challenges, environments, and use cases for each author-tool combination

### 3. Realistic Rating Variance
- **Author Bias**: Each author has baseline rating tendency based on their personality
- **Realistic Deviation**: 15-20% of reviews deviate from typical bias for authenticity
- **Distribution Examples**:
  - Ayn Rand (typically 5★): Occasionally 3-4★ when tools don't meet objectivist standards
  - HP Lovecraft (typically 2★): Rarely 4★ when tool surprisingly works well
  - Ernest Hemingway (typically 4★): Sometimes 3★ for overpriced or underperforming tools

## Author Rotation Strategy

### Current Rotation Pattern (Batches 1-15, 97 reviews completed)

**Batch Sequence Tracking:**
- Batch 1: Ayn Rand → Edgar Allan Poe → Virginia Woolf → George Orwell → Charles Dickens → Jack Kerouac → Oscar Wilde → Mark Twain
- Batch 2: HP Lovecraft → Jane Austen → Franz Kafka → Ernest Hemingway
- Batch 3: Ayn Rand → Edgar Allan Poe → Virginia Woolf → George Orwell
- Batch 4: Charles Dickens → Jack Kerouac → Oscar Wilde → HP Lovecraft
- Batch 5: Jane Austen → Franz Kafka → Ernest Hemingway → Mark Twain
- Batch 6: Virginia Woolf → George Orwell → Ayn Rand → Edgar Allan Poe
- Batch 7: Charles Dickens → Jack Kerouac → Oscar Wilde → HP Lovecraft
- Batch 8: Jane Austen → Franz Kafka → Ernest Hemingway → Mark Twain
- Batch 9: Ayn Rand → Edgar Allan Poe → Virginia Woolf → George Orwell
- Batch 10: Charles Dickens → Jack Kerouac → Oscar Wilde → HP Lovecraft
- Batch 11: Jane Austen → Franz Kafka → Ernest Hemingway → Mark Twain
- Batch 12: Virginia Woolf → George Orwell → HP Lovecraft → Jack Kerouac
- Batch 13: Charles Dickens → Jack Kerouac → Oscar Wilde → HP Lovecraft → Jane Austen
- Batch 14: Franz Kafka → Ernest Hemingway → Mark Twain → Ayn Rand → Edgar Allan Poe
- Batch 15: Virginia Woolf → George Orwell → HP Lovecraft → Jack Kerouac → Charles Dickens

**Next Batch Constraint**: Batch 16 cannot start with Charles Dickens (last author from Batch 15)

## Scenario Diversity Framework

### Project Categories Rotation
- **Construction**: Workshops, sheds, treehouses, pergolas, ramps, foundations
- **Restoration**: Antiques, boats, furniture, playground equipment, historical items

- **Personal**: Family projects, social events, seasonal maintenance, emergency repairs

### Author-Specific Scenario Patterns
- **Charles Dickens**: Humanitarian projects, community service, helping disadvantaged populations
- **Ayn Rand**: Individual achievement, property improvement, workshop construction, technological celebration
- **Ernest Hemingway**: Marine work, practical repairs, outdoor projects, no-nonsense functionality
- **HP Lovecraft**: Property security, basement work, family archives, cosmic anxiety about technology
- **Jack Kerouac**: Creative spaces, mobile projects, artistic freedom, spontaneous construction
- **Oscar Wilde**: Aesthetic projects, art installations, garden design, critique of utilitarian tools
- **Virginia Woolf**: Writing spaces, contemplative projects, literary settings, introspective construction

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Voice Consistency Verification
- **Vocabulary**: Author-specific word choices and expressions maintained
- **Sentence Structure**: Distinctive patterns (Hemingway's brevity, Dickens' elaboration, etc.)
- **Thematic Focus**: Core author concerns reflected in tool usage context
- **Rating Logic**: Consistent with author personality and stated experience

### Scenario Uniqueness Verification
- **Story Differentiation**: No recycled scenarios or similar contexts
- **Project Variety**: Different construction/repair/creative challenges
- **Problem Diversity**: Unique obstacles, successes, and outcomes
- **Setting Variation**: Home, community, workshop, outdoor, professional environments

### Technical Accuracy Verification
- **Tool Specifications**: Accurate power ratings, features, and capabilities
- **Bunnings Context**: Authentic shopping experience details
- **Use Case Realism**: Practical applications matching tool capabilities
- **Price Reference**: Consistent with actual tool pricing

## Progress Tracking

### Completion Status (Current: 97/420 reviews, 23.1%)
- **Phase 1 Complete**: Initial template development and testing
- **Phase 2 In Progress**: Systematic large-batch generation
- **Phase 3 Pending**: Quality validation and final cleanup

### Author Distribution (Current Count)
- Ayn Rand: 8 reviews
- Charles Dickens: 8 reviews  
- Edgar Allan Poe: 8 reviews
- Ernest Hemingway: 8 reviews
- Franz Kafka: 8 reviews
- George Orwell: 8 reviews
- HP Lovecraft: 8 reviews
- Jack Kerouac: 8 reviews
- Jane Austen: 8 reviews
- Mark Twain: 8 reviews
- Oscar Wilde: 8 reviews
- Virginia Woolf: 9 reviews

### Tool Coverage Progress
- **Reviews per Tool**: Target 12 (one per author)
- **Tools Completed**: 0/35 (several tools have 8-9 reviews, approaching completion)
- **Tools Started**: 35/35 (all tools have at least some reviews)

## Efficiency Optimizations

### Large Batch Strategy
- **Batch Size**: 10-15 reviews per batch for efficient parallel generation
- **Tool Data Preparation**: Pre-load multiple tool specifications for rapid generation
- **Author Voice Preparation**: Reference author JSON data for consistent voice parameters
- **Template Utilization**: Proven v2-bunnings-prompt-template.md for all generations

### Parallel Processing
- **Multiple Tool Reads**: Read 4-6 tool specifications simultaneously
- **Batch Generation**: Generate 5-10 reviews in single large edit operation when possible
- **Quality Verification**: Systematic check for voice consistency and scenario uniqueness

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Targets
- **Total Reviews**: 420 (12 authors × 35 tools)
- **Word Count**: 50-120 words per review
- **Rating Distribution**: Realistic variance within author bias patterns
- **Completion Timeline**: Systematic progress toward 100% coverage

### Qualitative Standards
- **Voice Authenticity**: Distinctive author personalities maintained throughout
- **Scenario Creativity**: Completely unique stories for each author-tool combination
- **Entertainment Value**: Humorous parody while maintaining believability
- **Technical Accuracy**: Correct tool specifications and practical applications

## Next Phase Strategy

### Batch 16+ Planning
- **Author Rotation**: Continue modified round-robin avoiding consecutive authors
- **Scenario Innovation**: Introduce new project types and contexts
- **Quality Maintenance**: Systematic verification of voice and scenario uniqueness
- **Acceleration**: Larger batches (15-20 reviews) to efficiently complete remaining 323 reviews

This systematic approach ensures consistent quality while scaling to complete all 420 reviews with maximum variety and entertainment value.
