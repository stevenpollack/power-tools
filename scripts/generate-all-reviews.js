- Author: ${author.name} (${author.lifespan}) - ${author.nationality}
- Literary Movement: ${author.literaryMovement}
- Tool: ${tool.name} by ${tool.brand}
- Category: ${tool.category}
- Key Features: ${tool.specifications.keyFeatures.join(", ")}
- Price: $${tool.pricing.currentPrice} ${tool.pricing.currency}

**Style Guidelines:**
- Writing Style: ${author.styleAnalysis.summary}
- Vocabulary: ${author.styleAnalysis.vocabulary}
- Sentence Structure: ${author.styleAnalysis.sentenceStructure}
- Key Themes: ${author.styleAnalysis.themes.join(", ")}
- Unique Quirks: ${author.styleAnalysis.quirks.join(", ")}

**Review Requirements:**
- Length: 200-300 words
- Mood: ${mood} (${mood === "humorous" ? "entertaining and funny" : mood === "dramatic" ? "intense and emotional" : mood === "technical" ? "focused on specifications" : "deep and contemplative"})
- Tone: ${tone} (${tone === "formal" ? "elevated and literary" : tone === "casual" ? "relaxed and conversational" : tone === "satirical" ? "witty and mocking" : "sincere and heartfelt"})
- Purpose: Pure entertainment, NOT genuine product advice
- Voice: Stay absolutely true to ${author.name}'s distinctive writing style

**Human Flourish to Include:**
Naturally incorporate this realistic detail: "${flourish}"

**Important Notes:**
- This is satirical content for entertainment purposes
- Include specific tool features naturally within the narrative
- Make it engaging and memorable while maintaining the author's voice
- End with a conclusion that feels authentically "${author.name}"
- The human flourish should feel organic to the review, not forced
